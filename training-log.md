Short one today because I was on a time crunch. Snatches feel like absolute garbage. Need more powers and OHS?

First full day of training in a while. I felt surprisingly strong and recovered, except in the snatch (of course). Focus of this next cycle is going to be step loading weights over 2-3 week cycles in all the lifts, and doing some more bodybuilding to gain some muscle. I would also like to do more pulling to get my back strength up.

Maybe some cardio too.

- Squat 3 x 4 x 365
- Snatch 205 x 3 x 1
- Clean and Jerk 265 x 2 x 1

- Deadlift 365 x 1 x 5
- Press 155 x 4 x 5

- Superset
- Flat Bar Curl 3 x 10
- Lat Pull Down 3 x 8 x 137.5

Using my busy schedule right now as an opportunity to take a break from training. Honestly, it's nice. Looking forward to getting after it on Monday.

- Pull Ups 4 x 5

Squatting with a belt and cutting depth seems to keep the back from getting irritated as much. Power cleans felt great. Focusing on keeping the arms long and relaxed seems to help leg drive and foot pressure.

- Squat 4 x 4 x 315
- Power Clean 235 x 3 x 2

- Press 4 x 4 x 155
- Push Press 3 x 2 x 225
- Row 3 x 3 x 225

- Superset Lat Pulldown 3 x 8 x 135, Face Pulls 3 x 10

Good training, but my low back wasn't happy with squats. Too much, too soon, I think. Taking the opportunity to step back and take it easy. Going to be step loading for a few months.

- Squat 3 x 5 x 365
- Snatch 205 x 1, 215 x 1, 225 x 1
- Clean and Jerk 275 x 3 x 1
- Push Press 225 x 3 x 3
- Press 155 x 3 x 5
