Squatting with a belt and cutting depth seems to keep the back from getting irritated as much. Power cleans felt great. Focusing on keeping the arms long and relaxed seems to help leg drive and foot pressure.

- Squat 4 x 4 x 315
- Power Clean 235 x 3 x 2

- Press 4 x 4 x 155
- Push Press 3 x 2 x 225
- Row 3 x 3 x 225

- Superset Lat Pulldown 3 x 8 x 135, Face Pulls 3 x 10

Good training, but my low back wasn't happy with squats. Too much, too soon, I think. Taking the opportunity to step back and take it easy. Going to be step loading for a few months.

- Squat 3 x 5 x 365
- Snatch 205 x 1, 215 x 1, 225 x 1
- Clean and Jerk 275 x 3 x 1
- Push Press 225 x 3 x 3
- Press 155 x 3 x 5
