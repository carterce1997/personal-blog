Usually I'm not proud of how I execute the lifts, but today I was. There is something to be said for the connection between the aesthetic quality of a lift and the physical quality of it. When a lift looks pleasing to the eye, it has been executed well. This is true in the strength lifts, but even truer in the classic lifts; few other movements combine grace and fluidity with maximal intensity, and the eye is pleased at the proper blend of the two.

Another thought. Training should be like virtue: doing the right thing in the little, mundane, everyday things. That's the defining quality of moral uprightness, and the path to becoming very strong. Each training session should be the most and the least important thing; not easy, but not maximal effort, and entirely mundane and predictable.

But before we get too Platonic, I should mention that my knee hurts. Oh well.

Short one today because I was on a time crunch. Snatches feel like absolute garbage. Need more powers and OHS?

First full day of training in a while. I felt surprisingly strong and recovered, except in the snatch (of course). Focus of this next cycle is going to be step loading weights over 2-3 week cycles in all the lifts, and doing some more bodybuilding to gain some muscle. I would also like to do more pulling to get my back strength up.

Maybe some cardio too.

- Squat 3 x 4 x 365
- Snatch 205 x 3 x 1
- Clean and Jerk 265 x 2 x 1

- Superset
- Flat Bar Curl 3 x 10
- Lat Pull Down 3 x 8 x 137.5

Using my busy schedule right now as an opportunity to take a break from training. Honestly, it's nice. Looking forward to getting after it on Monday.

Squatting with a belt and cutting depth seems to keep the back from getting irritated as much. Power cleans felt great. Focusing on keeping the arms long and relaxed seems to help leg drive and foot pressure.

- Squat 4 x 4 x 315
- Power Clean 235 x 3 x 2

- Press 4 x 4 x 155
- Push Press 3 x 2 x 225
- Row 3 x 3 x 225

- Superset Lat Pulldown 3 x 8 x 135, Face Pulls 3 x 10

Good training, but my low back wasn't happy with squats. Too much, too soon, I think. Taking the opportunity to step back and take it easy. Going to be step loading for a few months.

- Snatch 205 x 1, 215 x 1, 225 x 1
