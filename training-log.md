Loads are in pounds unless otherwise indicated.

Good training, but low back wasn't happy with squats. Too much, too soon, I think. Taking the opportunity to step back and take it easy. Going to be step loading for a few months. 

- Squat 3 x 5 x 365
- Snatch 205 x 1, 215 x 1, 225 x 1
- Clean and Jerk 275 x 3 x 1
- Push Press 225 x 3 x 3
- Press 155 x 3 x 5
