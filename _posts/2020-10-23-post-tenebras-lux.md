I often oversleep. On those days, being late to work is worth skipping a few waking minutes of existence.

Sometimes, the sweetest combination of despair and hope is a lot and a little. A bright keyhole in a prison cell door. A dark world, illuminated at a singularity; the same world where some friends and loved ones are laden with childhood abuse, another with the tragic loss of their young son in a housefire, and another with their enduring shame because of sexual assault.

The singularity, pinprick in the fabric of history: a Man on a Cross, enthroned with nails, crowned with thorns, robed with 39 lashes.

The King of all.

_Post tenebras lux._
