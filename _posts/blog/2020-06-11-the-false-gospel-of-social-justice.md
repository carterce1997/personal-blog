*Fathers shall not be put to death for their sons, nor shall sons be put to death for their fathers; everyone shall be put to death for his own sin. (Deuteronomy 28:16)*

*For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Romans 6:28)*

The veritable revival of social justice we are witnessing in our current day and age will almost surely split the evangelical church. 

The Biblical concept of justice is one where God renders to each individual man what he is due according to his righteousness and his sins, and where each man treats every other individual man what he is due according to the image of the One the other bears. God's Law renders to each man what he is due individually with what he has been given, as a result of his own actions alone. Furthermore, if God's Law is perfect, then it is the standard by which all other systems of legality must be measured against. When political entities bring about punishments for those who have not individually committed any sin against God or against them, you can be sure that those who assent to those actions will have to answer to God on judgement day for their unjust oppression of the innocent. And yes, "political entities" includes riots and bad cops. 

Social justice calls for the blood of the innocent to be shed for crimes they did not commit based on their socioeconomic status or the color of their skin. It does not even attempt to emulate God's perfect justice, and stands staunchly opposed to God's perfect law as an alternative foundation of society, namely a Marxist one. Where God's law condemns evil means, social justice condemns what it perceieves to be evil ends: wealth, status, power, flourishing, and the like.
