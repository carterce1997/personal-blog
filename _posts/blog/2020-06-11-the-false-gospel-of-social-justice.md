*Fathers shall not be put to death for their sons, nor shall sons be put to death for their fathers; everyone shall be put to death for his own sin. (Deuteronomy 28:16)*

*For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Romans 6:28)*

I write this, as a man who loves the Gospel above all, who desires to see the name of Jesus lifted on the wings of high praise, and whose heart would rejoice if his friends, his acquaintances, and his nation would repent and turn to Him. It is from scripture, and from the sanctifying work of Christ in me, that I declare that I cannot stand with those who promote social justice, nor can I fellowship as a Christian with those who believe that the Gospel is sufficient to restore the whole world to order, and peace, and righteousness. My heart is heavy for the state of my nation and the American church, which in a matter of months has gone from a lesuirely stroll along the path of Godless progressivism to making strenuous leaps and bounds. Simultaneously I praise God for those whom He will, by His sovereign decree, preserve to persevere through the churning waves of doctrine which assail us in these days. I know that the church will be purified. 

The call for solidarity with those who stand in favor of social justice has risen from an invitation to political assent to a hellfire sermon, which demands from its listeners far more than a mere proclamation of a leftist political stance on the meaning of "equality". Solidarity with social justice is more akin to a religious conversion: a paradigm shift wherein a person is enlightened to the reality of "systemic racism" and their contribution to its propagation through their "priviledge". As the concepts which underpin Critical Theory and Marxism occupy more of the verbage of public discourse, so the justification for these concepts grows, and it will not be long before a great majority of the population agrees with some of these critical doctrines. Doctrines, for example, that affirm that those of "priviledge" have been educated in the ways of systemic oppression from the time they were young, are used to justify the conviction of the innocent, on the grounds that their skin is the wrong color, they are the wrong gender (or "identify" with the gender they were given at birth), or that their religion is a little too close to orthodox Christianity. There is no forgiveness for these kinds of sins, and thus the sons shall be put to death for the sins of their fathers.
