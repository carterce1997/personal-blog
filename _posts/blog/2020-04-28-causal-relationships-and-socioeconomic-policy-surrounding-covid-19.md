Federal and state health officials claim there exists a causal relationship between taking distancing measures, like economic shutdown, and the mitigation of the spread of infectious disease. They won't use the words "causal relationship" outright, but their adamence that officials force the adoption of these distancing policies is indicative that they believe very strongly that "if we do social distancing, then COVID-19 will be mitigated". 

Let me credential myself for a second, before we get too far into this. I am a recent graduate of Clarkson University with a Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics. My coursework and research work focused on mathematical modeling and Bayesian statistics, which are disciplines that seek to understand and model real-world phenomena in order to draw conclusions and make policies. During my education I collaborated with professors and graduate students on a great variety of research work pertinent to these kinds of problems.

To establish a causal claim based on empirical information, you must demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that some phenomenon was the cause of another (don't think too hard about it). To do this, we normally look for a couple of things:

1. We must be sure that the supposed antecedent event actually occurred in some logically prior fashion to the supposed consequent. If you claim that event A caused event B, but B occurred before A, you know that A could not have caused B based on every sane theory of time and cause-and-effect. 
2. We must demonstrate the consequent under the proposed conditional, and the negation of the consequent under the counterfactual conditional (slow down there, boy). All this means is that we must be sure that event A caused event B by checking the case when we don't have event A. If we see that A implies B, but also that the negation of A implies B, then we know that B must be caused by something other than A. This is why drug studies have some portion of subjects take a sugar pill, to analyze what would happen if the treatment under study wasn't applied to the patient.

With the second point in mind, we can instantly see the problem. Every major modernized nation on the planet has adopted social distancing as a mitigation strategy, but without any one of them not adopting distancing measures there is no way to be sure if the distancing caused the mitigation of the disease or not. There is no way to tell if distancing caused the mitigation, or if the virus just ran through the population quietly and people became resistant to reinfection, mitigating the disease.

No matter how convincing the arguments from health officials sound, unless we have counterfactual evidence of distancing measures not mitigating the disease in a statistically significant way, **there is no evidence that social distancing and economic shutdown is an empirically verified method of mitigating COVID-19.**

So, what justification do health officials have for distancing? 

Most of the decisions surrounding this disease have been formulated based on computer models. Basically, an epidemiologist comes to a mathematician like me and says "this diseases works like x, y, z, show me what happens if an outbreak occurs", and I build a mathematical model to simulate in the computer. This is called "modeling from first principles" as opposed to "data-driven modeling" which is done in the empirical analysis of causality. Modeling from first principles is great when you don't have a lot of data about a phenomenon you would like to understand, but you do have some idea for the mechanism of the phenomenon. This is why it's used so often to model disease outbreak. By making a model, you can run through a bunch of different scenarios as to how the outbreak would respond to different situations, like different levels of distancing, and you could construct your own causal analysis based on the assumptions of the model you built.
