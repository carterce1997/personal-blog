It is horribly cliche to say that we, as a species, are living in an age where too much of our lives are experienced through the abstraction provided for us by technological advancement, distracting us from what it really means to be human. I hate cliches, and I really hate being like everyone else, but let me say this: if we are driven "forward" by the engine of technological advancement, then we are moving towards something, and moving away from something else. I won't bother to say much more.

It is one thing to read, to study, and to discuss the words of our Lord in an academic manner, when He says, "I am the vine, and my Father is the keeper of the vineyard. He cuts off every branch in Me that bears no fruit, and every branch that does bear fruit, He prunes to make it even more fruitful," but it is another thing to ponder them and treasure them organically, as you cut away the dead stalks from some raspberry bushes in the late afternoon. I would imagine that Jesus gave us His parables for the moments in our lives when we could easily comprehend their meaning, that even in the mundaneness of our chores, the gentle snip of the pruners would soothe our burdened minds to understanding, and we would begin to grasp something of eternity.
