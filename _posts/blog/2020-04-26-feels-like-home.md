I've spent a lot of my life looking for a place that felt like home.



When I was young, I looked forward to opportunities to strike out on my own and show myself that I could handle it. College was one kind of opportunity, internships were another, and living on my own in a new city to start a job was yet another. I grew a lot from all of those experiences. Most things, including life itself, are best learned by jumping in over your head, figuring out which end is up, and making every mistake in the book. You don't have a plan, and you don't know enough to make one, but you walk forward trusting that every step is foreordained by God to be taken exactly when and where you actually take it. Most of the game is learning to trust that "He's got you", even when you can't seem to keep up with all the change in life.



We like to think that we ride along in life alongside our closest companions forever. In reality, we found them huddled around a campfire some lonely night, figured out which way they were headed, and decided it was a route close enough to ours to bear going along with them for a little while. When you do, it's a little taste of forever. That's what friendship is. Eventually, one day, you have to take a pause, squint at your map, and figure out that if you keep going too much further on the same trail you'll be a decent number of miles off your own course. Most often you have to part ways. Sometimes, it's exactly right. Sometimes, it's worth it not to get there. And sometimes, you end up with a broken heart no matter what choice you make. You soldier on, camping alone for a little while until you bump into someone else.



Friends and family make home what it is. Sometimes, I wish there weren't so many trails.
