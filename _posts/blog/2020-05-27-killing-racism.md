I have such a deep ache in my heart for the state of this world, and the state of the church.

Racism has become an increasingly prominent topic of conversation, no doubt because of the recent acts of injustice which have occurred over the last several months. I am heartbroken and enraged that these despicable acts were undertaken, and I believe that the perpetrators of these acts ought to be brought to swift justice.

Saying that does not appear to be enough anymore, nor does it seem that it would be enough to say that justice must be served to a perpetrator of any color, against a victim of any color. Popular conceptions of the problem indicate that we must not only recognize explicit injustice against someone, but also recognize that the act was a part of a larger systemic problem which lurks implicitly in every white mind and in every structure of society, even if no explicit acts of racism have been committed by either kind of party. 

Recognizing a problem is not the same thing as fixing the problem. I want to end racism and eradicate it from the world for the injustice that it is, and simply saying "so-and-so is racist" or "such-and-such organization is racist" or "we all are implicitly racist" is not a solution to the problem of racism. Thus far, I have not heard of a solution to the problem of racism that can be implemented once the problem has been found.
