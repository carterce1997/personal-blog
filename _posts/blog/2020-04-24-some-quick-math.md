Here's what we know:

1. New York's antibody testing suggests that 1 in 5 New Yorkers may have had the Coronavirus at some point. Most of the testing was done in New York City, so this will be our region of interest.
2. New York City has a population of around 8.4 million people, and New York state has a population of around 20 million people.
3. As of today, 15,740 people have died from COVID-19 in the entire state of New York. 10,290 of those have occurred in the city.
4. If 1 in 5 New Yorkers had COVID-19 at some point, that's a recovered population of around 1.7 million people.
5. Dividing the number of deaths by the number of estimated unmeasured cases, we arrive at a mortality rate of around 0.58%, or around 1 in 200.
