Within the United States, there is a great divide, originall noticed and recorded by Pat Buchanan in the early 90s. Buchanan noticed a significant divide in the country, almost unilaterally, on issues like abortion, homosexuality, gun rights, and other polarizing issues. On one side were the traditionalists, who advocated for family values, were pro-life, advicated that marriage was inherently heterosexual, and generally favored a more libertarian action of government. One the other side were the progressives, who held almost the exact opposite stance on these issues, and celebrated a "nontraditional" view of marriage, family, and sexuality, preferred limited freedoms, more social programs, and a generally larger and more powerful government. As the two worldviews cannot coexist, one must be the arbitor of the supreme ethic of national life, and so a culture war began to rage.
