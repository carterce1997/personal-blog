Loneliness has always been my great affliction. Throughout my life I have often felt rejected, overlooked, or outcast, enjoyed by friends and people when I am around, but forgotten in my absence. Being alone in and of itself carries with it some inherent discomfort, but for me, the greater pain comes from the hermeneutics of what being alone means, or rather how I interpret being alone. How I perceive the situation is a far more debilitating toxin to my soul than what being alone merely is. Being alone is the simple experience of solitude, but to me, and because of my life experiences, I have a habit of concluding that I am alone because I am rejected. Solitude is a vacuum where my fears and insecurities have room to become strengthened and rise up to devour me; a vacancy of acceptance which must be resolved by explanation, whose only explanation must be some failure of mine, or some unacceptable inadequacy in my character. Loneliness, to me, is not merely discomfort during peace and quiet, it is a deafening torment of self-criticism deep longing to be loved and accepted.

No doubt, in times where social distancing and social isolation are mandates of the state, and people are afraid to enjoy human interaction for fear of viral infection, loneliness has burdened many people with similar afflictions. In all times in history, loneliness has is an inescapable and imminent part of human experience; even at the beginning of time, as is accounted in the book of Genesis, God created Adam as a perfect man, and yet Adam was lonely. God has designed us so that intimacy and connection with other people is a necessary and foundational part of our existence, and the absence of Adam's meaningful relationship with another person was the first thing in all of Creation that God declared "not good". Thus God created Eve, the woman, a suitable companion for Adam, and he was no longer lonely. When Adam sinned, and plunged the world into bondage to sin and decay, that which was "not good" reigned over the world. In the corrupted nature of man, murder, envy, lust, pride, and all other manner of sin had solid ground to stand on. Because of this, the effects of sin ran rampant as well; loss, betrayal, pain, loneliness, and all other manner of that which was never intended to be a part of the human experience became the experience of everyone. We are both the victims and the perpetrators of the brokenness which we and those around us experience. This is what sin does. Loneliness is a heavy burden born by all, from those who have been persecuted and isolated for doing the will of God, to those who have lost loved ones, to those who are looking for love, to those who have moved to a new city or a new country, to those who live alone, to those who feel like they just don't have anyone who would answer the phone if they just needed someone to talk to.

Even our Lord Jesus, who was loved and cherished by His disciples, was betrayed by them and left alone to the full brunt of the humiliation, ridicule, and torment which He would experience as He faced the cross. Peter, His best friend, denied that he knew Jesus, and left Him alone to face what was to come. Jesus was ridiculed and accused of crimes He did not commit in a court of false witnesses, was stripped of his clothes, was flogged into unrecognizable form, was spat upon, insulted, and thrown food at as he was crowned with thorns, before he carried the same cross He would be nailed to, to Golgotha, outside the city, where He would die a criminal's death, alone and accursed with the sin of the world on His shoulders. So deep, and so profound, and so complete was the loneliness of Jesus, that even God the Father turned His face away from Him, to shun Him as an accursed man, the innocent one, who bore the weight of the sin of the world so that by faith wretched men like me would be reconciled to God.

For God to justify sinners, it could have been no other way: that Christ was the loneliest man on Earth.

In our loneliness, we can be comforted that we have our great King Jesus, who is alive and seated in Heaven, to understands our pains and our afflictions. Though the pangs of loneliness often bring me to crippling depression, I know that my suffering is understood by my King, and further, I trust His promise that He will return to the Earth to eradicate all sin, and all evil, and all evildoers, and cast them into the lake of fire where they will be forever judged for their evil deeds, as those who are complicit in the corruption of this world. I know that I, because of Christ, will live forever with Him and with His people, never to be alone or lonely again, never having to question my worth in the eyes of those that I love; that on the day when all of God's people, the Church are wedded to Him, that He will wipe away every tear that was ever shed by those who love Him, and they will look forward at the future with nothing to dread, and nothing to fear. A blessed day.

Though I am tired of this world and tired of being alone, my suffering is a light and momentary affliction, well worth bearing for the unimaginable joy which awaits me when I go to meet my Lord.
