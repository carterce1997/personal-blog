A recent episode of a Christian podcast that I listened to on the nature of conspiracy theories, and how they ought to be dealt with in the Christian life, was a gauntlet of strawmen. Our present situation has spawned a host of conspiracy theories as to the nature of it, some more extreme than others. No doubt you've heard them, so I find no need to enumerate any examples here, and I won't be discussing the veracity of any of them. I would like, instead, to provide a bit of a response to a pattern which I have witnessed concerning the general presentation of conspiracy theories in public discourse.

Conspiracy theories are presented as a dilemma: a double proposition of the two extreme explanations of the phenomena at hand. Either every detail of the situation was orchestrated, front to back, top to bottom, using the latest technology and the most sinister tools of the deepest echelons of the government, or else the mainstream narrative is the truth. If the cogency of the former preposition can be shown to be fallacious by virtue of absurdity, then the usual rules of inference would force us to conclude the veracity of the latter.
