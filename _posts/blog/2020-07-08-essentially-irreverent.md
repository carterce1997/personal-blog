Ironically, it is in the book of Jonah where we get a glimpse of what widespread repentance looks like. Jonah was tasked by God to deliver a warning of God's judgement against Ninevah, a wicked city. Upon reluctantly delivering his brief message concerning their impending destruction, Jonah witnessed the entire city of wicked men and women cry out to God, and don themselves with sackcloth and ashes in brokenhearted repentance. God, upon seeing their repentance, relented from the destruction of the city.

If the United States were a Christian nation, we would have been compelled to our knees in repentance for our vile and Godless deeds at the first report of the impending pandemic. Lord knows our sexual promiscuity, our celebration of homosexuality and transgenderism, our systemic murder of unborn children, and our irreverence and deception which we proliferate in our policies and our churches through lukewarm and false teachers have warranted us a punishment far worse than COVID-19. Such wrath is being stored up for the Day of Judgment. Instead of revering and fearing God, we abandoned hope that God would be gracious to repentant souls, and we declared the weekly gathering of believers to worship the Almighty Creator of the Universe to be a "non essential" service. We made statements regarding the mitigation of the disease such as "God did not do that" (in case we needed any extra information to infer the state of Andrew Cuomo's mind towards God). Even as states are "allowing" believers to return to worship, singing praises to God is still a prohibited activity. Worse still, many churches were okay with shutting their doors for the purpose of mitigating the spread of the disease. That is how little we hope in God: we would sooner trade the riches of repentance, and the greatness and joy of right relationship with the Lord through Christ, for panicked survival tactics.

In the book of Hebrews, chapter 10, believers are admonished to not forsake gathering together to edify and encourage one another in the worship of God, not as a matter of "Christian living", but as a logical consequence of the greatness of God in Christ. Gathering together to lift our voices in prayer, in preaching, and in praise is the primary means by which we testify to ourselves, and to others, and to the world, the unfathomable greatness of God in Christ. We do this, in keeping with the tradition set forth by our Lord Himself, who gathered with His followers to break bread, fellowship, weep, pray, and join together in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. By these things, we proclaim that God is able to save us from our sin, and from every calamity which could befall us.

Repent, my nation, and repent, my brothers and sisters; gather together to weep, and to turn to God in sackcloth, ashes, and praise.
