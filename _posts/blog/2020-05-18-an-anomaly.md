I still don't know why Jesus was crucified for me. The cross is one of those things that, as I behold, becomes more and more profound to me. The Law of Sin is easy to understand, and the manner of a sinful world is easy to comprehend, if you start with the axiom that men hate God, are desperately selfish, and are profoundly dissatisfied with the created order. To say that all of human history is a trivial deduction from these axioms is overstating the claim, but human behavior becomes a lot less complicated to understand if these things are the origin of the analysis. Tyranny, deception, murder, rape, theft, and the rest of the like, are all too familiar to us. Not only do we read of them in the news, and not only do we receive these things from others, but within our very bones lie the same lusts which drive men to commit these acts.

The cross follows none of the laws of sin, nor is it justice. In my mind, God incarnate is not supposed to die on behalf of me. What am I but a gnat, a perpetrator of cosmic treason, a microbe of scum which contaminates God's perfect paradise, an object deserving of eternal punishment for the dishonor, disobedience, and defamation which I bring to His name. Were Jesus to remain, without becoming incarnate, I would get what I deserve, and He would get what He deserves. He gave me His life, His holiness, His goodness, His righteous standing before God the Father, in exchange for my death, my weak affections, my frequent transgressions against Him, my hollow religion, and my shallow convictions. What did He gain, if I am the way that I am? Who am I, if He gave this to me? Who is He, if this is how He loves me?
