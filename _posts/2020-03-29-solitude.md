You move beyond my eyes <br>
And speak words beyond my ears <br>
I cannot conceive Your thoughts <br>
Nor can I understand Your ways. <br>

<br>

I sense You like a thick fog <br>
You envelop me at every place and time <br>
And move my heart either to rejoice <br>
Or to break. <br>

<br>

Why does solitude wash me with unbearable despair? <br>
Who is closer to me than You? <br>
How indescribably horrible am I <br>
That Your presence isn’t enough for me? <br>
