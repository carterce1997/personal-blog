<div class="box">Your probably checking those geographic data analytics for your blog, guessing that your fan in Canada is still a fan. I'm here to say that it's true. However I'd like to describe myself as a fan in opposition, because I disagree with so much of what you write it's not funny. But I enjoy reading it a lot. You're a great writer. Keep it up and treat yoself to a coffee. But I'm only buying you one because of this darn stupid exchange rate. Cheers.</div>

Thanks Jenna, and thanks for the coffee too. Google analytics almost always shows me a couple Canadian pings (completely anonymized of course). Those exchange rates can be a real pain, but international relations and healthy opposition probably do an aspiring writer some good, so I appreciate you reaching out and expressing some kind words. I try to keep it interesting around here: theology, occasional rigor, humor to leaven, salt to taste, and probably too many semicolons. Whatever it is, I'm glad you enjoy it.
