I've been lifting weights consistently for about 6 years of my life, and I have learned a lot of lessons in the weight room. Lately, training has preoccupied my thought, and I think I have a more mature and balanced outlook on what training should look like for regular guys like me.

There was a time when I thought I wanted to be a strength athlete, devoted almost entirely to powerlifting or olympic weightlifting. Having trained with that level of seriousness at points, and having been exposed to both sports, my outlook now has changed. Firstly, many people who get into training with a barbell or other strength implements have a bad habit of limiting their training activity with a label, e.g., "I'm a powerlifter so I don't do cleans" or "I'm a weightlifter so I don't need to worry about my upper body" or "I'm a strongman, so I don't need to worry about having good technique in the push press". The truth is, unless you're a national level athlete competing in national or international level competitions, you aren't a weightlifter, a powerlifter, or a strongman. You have not specialized enough to deserve a title like that, much less are you specialized enough to train the same way that elite level weightlifters, powerlifters, or strongmen actually do. A 200lbs male with a 405lbs back squat, a 315lbs bench press, and a 500lbs deadlift is a strong guy who has undoubtedly worked very hard, but these numbers by no means indicate a specialization in powerlifting. The same can be said with comparable numbers in other strength sports.

The delusion of specialization feeds itself; it's the reason why "powerlifters" don't train the overhead press,  why "strongmen" don't do snatches or clean and jerks, and why "weightlifters" neglect their upper body. In reality, amateur and intermediate "powerlifters" could probably benefit from pressing overhead and doing power cleans as a light day pulling exercise. Many professional strongmen got their start in weightlifting, and are generally more explosive and better able to use their legs for overhead events than "strongmen" think that improving at the sport just means getting fat. Weightlifters are the worst offenders; they carry a pseudo-intellectual attitude that anything outside of the snatch, the clean and jerk, and the high bar back squat is at best a necessary evil, and at worst cancerous, an attitude which leads them to preoccupy themselves with silly all-pain-no-gain exercises like hip snatches and excessively long complexes. More benching and deadlifts, and low bar squats won't kill you...just get over it.

Claiming to be a "strength athlete" also comes along with other excuses, like being fat.
