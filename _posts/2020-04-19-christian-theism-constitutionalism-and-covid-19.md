The injustice of human government can only be held in check if the fear of God is placed within the Civil Magisterium. We Christians learn from the Apostle that we the citizens are to submit to Government, as those who have been given authority from God to rule our nation. We do this for the Lord's sake, as a willing submission to His authority, and not for the government's sake, as submission to the decree of the Civil Magistrate.
