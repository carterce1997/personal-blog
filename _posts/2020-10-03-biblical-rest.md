It seems to me that God gave us 6 days to work and 1 day to rest. The usual argument opposing this is that Christ is our _true_ Sabbath and therefore we don't need to observe the Sabbath as Christians today. Yes and amen, Christ is our true Sabbath; we strive no longer in Him. But if we affirm that God's 6-1 work/rest split is null and void in the Christian age, what's the best way to partition our rest among our work? 7 days on, full throttle? 5 days of work and 2 days of rest, with workday evenings filled with 4 hour periods of hardcore Call of Duty and binge watching Season 2 of The Office in one go? What does "rest" even mean?

If you're a Christian, you should be a Sabbatarian. The Sabbath was made for man, after all. It's debated what that actually means, and what it means to you will depend on the convictions of your own conscience, but essentially, you should work for six days, and take a break from work on the seventh day, excepting dire extenuating circumstances where you have to work (a.k.a., if your ox falls into a pit on the Sabbath, you should pull it out). What's "work" and what's "rest"? Well, if it's part of your vocation (career, job, research, school, education, or another endeavor) it's work, and you should rest from it on the Sabbath. If it's something that recharges you or allows you to recharge in order to do your work better, then it's rest. I think there's allowed to be a bit of overlap. On a Tuesday evening, I could read Calvin and call it "researching Calvin's Institutes" and put it under the category of work. On a Sunday afternoon, I could read Edwards and call it "chillin' with Edwards". Most things don't have this kind of overlap, but some do.

I write this, because it's very easy to do things which are neither work, nor rest. Scrolling through Instagram is neither work nor rest. It's just garbage, and you shouldn't do it. I also think that most Christians don't work enough, since we are constantly baited by a culture which tells us that we need and deserve our rest throughout the work week. Most of the week should be filled with vocational labor of various kinds: career, education, athletic endeavors, family matters, ministries, and the like. If we manage our time well, then we have our sleep and Sabbath to rest, and we don't need to watch football or mess around on Fortnite for hours on end in order to unwind .
