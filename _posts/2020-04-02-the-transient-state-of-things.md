In times of calamity I find myself pondering not how things have gone so horribly wrong, but how things seemed to remain stable for the great duration of serenity leading up to the calamity. The last time that infectious disease brought about a comparable amount of havoc to the one we are currently experiencing was in 1918, with the outbreak of the Spanish Flu. Even now the epidemiological effect is not nearly what it was in that time. If it's not a virus we are waging war against, then it is political tension, or threat of terrorism, or business cycles, or natural disasters. Humans are not, as Rousseau would say, "noble savages" who only need to learn how to return to a state of nature to bring stability to the world. That's an idea only the most clueless academic could have, as anyone with their head in the practical day-to-day will realize that human dysfunction and calamity are always present at every moment in latent form, sometimes kept at bay by human ingenuity, and sometimes kept at bay by simple luck. At the limits of both, we experience the invocation of Stein's Law: "if something cannot go on forever, it will stop".

We would be tempted to believe that the interference of calamity in daily life can be mitigated by the acquisition or redistrubution of human power, in that, 1) we believe that by our own might we can create a world devoid of calamity by investing our energy in continual scientific and political progress, or 2) we have a duty to defer our own power to those in authority over us because we percieve them to be more competent in handling a situation of calamity. As a scientist, a bit of a technologist myself, and a guy who believes his Bible when it says "submit to government", I think these are wise things to do in the proper context. Where they become improper is when they become antecedent to a false consequent, as doing these things places no guarantee on the likelihood of future calamity as a whole, nor the efficiency of the mitigation of a current one. All we can do is trade calamity of one sort for calamity of another sort as technological and political advancements are made. "Vanity of vanities" is the most prominent Biblical comment on all of human activity. The book of Ecclesiastes drives this maxim with a sledgehammer, as if God were urging man to look around at the futility of progress, and then to look within and consider the great existential dread which is He has placed him. This is the same dread which was felt by the congregants who were within earshot of Jonathan Edwards' infamous *Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God*, a simple exposition of God's wrath, preached to lift the eyes of the congregation from the business of their daily lives, and to gaze with fresh eyes at the striking peril of eternal judgement which awaits men at every moment. We are not great beasts who stand on solid ground; we are impotent spiders, clinging to brittle strands of web suspended above a roaring fire, held out of the flames by the unmerited kindness of God towards His enemies.

Worldly calamity will always come and go, just as it has always come and gone. Even the greatest wars and plagues and political conflicts of human history eventually met their end. By Stein's Law, COVID-19 will eventually become a thing of the past, and in the future, new diseases will cause similar pandemic situations. To those who are in Christ, calamity is a reminder of the transience of this life, that this world is not our home, and that a better world awaits us in the coming millennia. To those who are not in Christ, calamity serves as a grave warning of the fagility of life, and the imminence of the greater calamity of God's judgement.
