In times of calamity I find myself pondering not how things have gone so horribly wrong, but how things seemed to remain stable for the great duration of serenity leading up to the calamity. The last time that infectious disease brought about a comparable amount of havoc to the one we are currently experiencing was in 1918, with the outbreak of the Spanish Flu. Even now the epidemiological effect is not nearly what it was in that time. If it's not a virus we are waging war against, then it is political tension, or threat of terrorism, or business cycles, or natural disasters. Humans are not "noble savages" roaming around a Rousseauian paradise; that's an idea only the most clueless academic could have, as anyone with their head in the practical day-to-day will realize that calamity is always present at every moment in latent form, sometimes kept at bay by human ingenuity, and sometimes kept at bay by simple luck. At the limits of both, we experience the invocation of Stein's Law: "if something cannot go on forever, it will stop".

We would be tempted to believe that the interference of calamity in daily life can be mitigated by the acquisition of human power. This manifests itself in two ver different ways. 1) We believe that by our own might we can create a world devoid of calamity by investing our energy in continual scientific and political progress. 2) We defer our own power to handle a situation of calamity to those in authority over us because we percieve them to be more competent in handling the situation.

There was no man who knew more in his time than the Teacher, the writer of the book of Ecclesiastes. Likely, this man was King of Israel, and on account of the life he describes in the autobiographical introduction to the book authorship is often attributed to King Solomon himself. Explicit authorship is excluded from the text to highlight the timeless nature of truths which could have been spoken by knowledgeable and wise men, the most prominent being "vanity of vanities", a comment on all human endeavors. The book drives this point with a sledgehammer. Ecclesiastes is an urging from God to look within, and consider the great existential dread which is He has placed within all those who have turned their backs upon Him. It is the same dread which was felt by the congregants who were within earshot of Jonathan Edwards' infamous *Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God*, a simple exposition of God's wrath, preached to convey the striking peril of eternal judgement which awaits men at every moment of their lives, as if every person was like a spider hanging from a brittle strand of web above a roaring campfire.

To those who are in God because of Christ, calamity is a reminder of the transience of life, that this world is not our home, and that a better world awaits us in the coming millennia. To those who are not, calamity of any sort is a grave warning of things to come: restless change, until the Changeless One appears to signify the end of days. No amount of knowledge will halt the decay to which the Universe is bound, driven by the engine of entropy, nor will a cleverly built society postpone the return of Christ.
