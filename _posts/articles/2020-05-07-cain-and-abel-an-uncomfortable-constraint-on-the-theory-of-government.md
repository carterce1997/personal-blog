Implicit in the desire for a larger and more powerful government is the belief that those in government are morally superior people, whose intentions are entirely benevolent towards those of the populace they rule over. Once we have collectively established as a society that God does not exist, then it is easy to make the leap to moral relativism, and then to ontological relativism. There is no God, so say and do as you please; there is no God, so believe "your truth", whatever it happens to be; there is no God, so there can be no "God-given" inalienable rights. The liberal perspective that Constitutional rights are a prescriptive enumeration of acceptable behavior for the citizens to partake of, endowed upon them by the government, lends itself to the tyranny of the majority. If constitutional laws mean only what they are interpreted to mean, and if they have their ontological origin in the canonization of the constitution itself by the hands of men, then they may be uncanonized by the hands of men as well. A democratic republic only has to have enough hands to amend them; a tyranny of many. 

Combined with this fact is the profound desire of man to be governed. Without a framework within which we can operate lawfully, we are doomed to wander aimlessly in an ethical vacuum. We would rather gravitate to any ethic at all than to hold to none. The challenge is the selection of the ethical axioms. The entire history of politics is a sequence of arguments about what is right and what is wrong, arguments which burn the fires of conflict to turn the wheels of policy and revolution which, in turn, build and destroy civilizations. Almost no one agrees on what is right and what is wrong, but even the most ardent moral relativist must operate in a framework where they assume some things to be righteous and other things to be hanus, if only practically. Godly people do not bother with such deliberation, as they prefer ubiquitously to accept the axioms of morality, and thus law, which have been written in God's word. The secular must engineer their own morality, and without a God who judges men according to His Law, the root of morality must lie with human government. There is no other place for it to lie. 

At this point the secularist may proudly interject, noting the dissent in my semantics, that this is not necessarily a bad thing. After all, provided we have a competent means of vetting individuals who can participate in the workings of government, we simply have to take care only to elect the best and brightest politicians to power.
