Implicit in the desire for a larger and more powerful government is the belief that those in government are morally superior people, whose intentions are entirely benevolent towards those of the populace they rule over. Once we have collectively established as a society that God does not exist, then it is easy to make the leap to moral relativism, and then to ontological relativism. There is no God, so say and do as you please; there is no God, so believe "your truth", whatever it happens to be; there is no God, so there can be no "God-given" inalienable rights. The liberal perspective that Constitutional rights are a prescriptive enumeration of acceptable behavior for the citizens to partake of, endowed upon them by the government, lends itself to the tyranny of the majority. If constitutional laws mean only what they are interpreted to mean, and if they have their ontological origin in the canonization of the constitution itself by the hands of men, then they may be uncanonized by the hands of men as well. A democratic republic only has to have enough hands to amend them; a tyranny of many. 

Combined with this fact is the profound desire of man to be governed by other men. Without a framework within which we can operate lawfully, we are doomed to wander aimlessly in an ethical vacuum. We would rather gravitate to any ethic at all than to hold to none. The challenge is the selection of the ethical axioms. The entire history of politics is a sequence of arguments about what is right and what is wrong, arguments which burn the fires of conflict to turn the wheels of policy and revolution which, in turn, build and destroy civilizations. Almost no one agrees on what is right and what is wrong, but even the most ardent moral relativist must operate in a framework where they assume some things to be righteous and other things to be hanus, if only practically. Godly people do not bother with such deliberation, as they prefer ubiquitously to accept the axioms of morality, and thus law, which have been written in God's word. The secular must engineer their own morality, and without a God who judges men according to His Law, the root of morality must lie with human government. There is no other place for it to lie, and the secular are glad for the the moral law of society to be administered to them by government officials in order to fill the great chasm of lawlessness which every man has dug out of his own chest; a chasm meant to be filled over and pressed down firmly with the aggregate of God's Law. Man's desire to be ruled by other men is so strong that even the Israelites, who lived in the presence of God and were guided by His every decree, begged for a human king. 

At this point the secularist may proudly interject, noting the dissent in my semantics, that mankind's strong desire for human governance is not necessarily a vice. After all, provided we have a competent means of vetting individuals who can participate in the workings of government, we simply have to take care only to elect the best politicians to power: those who represent the people best will rule them as one sympathetic to their true needs. If God does not exist, then the civil magistrate does not need to concern themselves with their God-given responsibility of legislation and execution of laws according to what is true, and what is in accordance with God's prescription of righteousness and evil; they merely need to concern themselves with appeasing the masses, or doing as they see fit themselves. Likewise, a secular judge does not need to concern themselves with judging and sentencing according to the wisdom and objectivism of the Righteous Judge who has granted them the privilege of emulating Him, they need only to worry about "interpreting" the law in order to appease the masses, or to provide legal precedence for their own agenda. The secular magistrate has no transcendent power to answer to, and if they seek to do as they please, they must only quell the dissent of the masses and their fellow magistrates, whose ungrounded wills and opinions may be easily manipulated by appeals first to desire, and then to the propagandized the "new normal", and then to majority rule.

For these reasons C.S. Lewis was right to call subjectivism, an inherent component of secularism, a poison. It is a toxin which, when administered, rots the skeleton of society. We must now characterize the conditions for its administration. Though many philosophers throughout history have made it their mission to engineer principles that moral and epistemological truths may find some stable footing upon in the absence of God, such as Epicureanism and Stoicism, Ayn Rand's Objectivism, Kant's Categorical Imperative, and so on. These attempts, while noble, hold as axiomatic that mankind wants to behave reasonably all the time; as if the only thing standing in the way of utopian human behavior is that we haven't crunched down the right principles of morality. Why should we assume that people are rational at all, much less that they want to behave rationally? Better yet, in a secular sense, what moral imperative is there to behave rationally? What does rationality even mean, and how could you deduce what it means without a foundation of deductive algebra? Those who find success in influencing others do not appeal to their rationality, understanding what Christians already know: that mankind is a passionate creature before he is a rational one; he thinks firstly with his belly and secondarily with his mind. 

All of secularism is doomed to fail; no matter the complexity of its treaties, the stability of its economies, the nobility of its philosophies, the duration of its traditions, the foundation of secular society rests upon agreements made between depraved men that are predicated on principles engineered by depraved men. Just as that which is made by the hands and will of man has an origin in time, so that which was even created even with utmost cleverness will have an eventual termination in time. The churn of the events of history is driven, in part, by the entropic reactions of matter in time: storms, plagues, natural disasters, and all the other effects of the amoral world. An analysis of the events of history must always take these things into account: the so-called "real" effects referenced by economists. The other reactions are driven conspiratorily, as the result of parties conspiring with or  warring against other parties, towards the accomplishment of the desired agenda. Mankind is not content with the quiet governance of God over all of life, for the vices of sin cause him to quest insatiably for political change, social revolution, and sensual satisfaction. No man can just "let things be".
