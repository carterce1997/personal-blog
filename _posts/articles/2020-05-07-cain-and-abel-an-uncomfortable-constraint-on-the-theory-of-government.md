All of secularism is doomed to spiral into chaos, no matter the complexity of its treaties, the stability of its economies, the nobility of its philosophies, or the duration of its traditions, the foundation of secular society rests upon agreements made between depraved men that are predicated on principles engineered by depraved men. Just as that which is made by the hands and will of man has an origin in time, so that which was even created even with utmost cleverness will have an eventual termination in time. The churn of the events of history is driven, in part, by the entropic reactions of matter in time: storms, plagues, natural disasters, and all the other effects of the amoral world. An analysis of the events of history must always take these things into account: the so-called "real" effects referenced by economists in their analysis of human behavior. The other reactions are driven as the result of parties conspiring with or warring against other parties, towards the accomplishment of a desired agenda. Mankind is not content with the quiet governance of God over all of life, for the vices of sin cause him to quest insatiably for political change, social revolution, and sensual satisfaction. Man cannot live his life satisfied with what God has given him, but takes every opportunity to leverage his existing circumstances for selfish gain. We are, by our very nature, so thoroughly opposed to the tranquil government of God's providence, that we will go to profoundly extreme injustice to accomplish our own will. "God's world is unfit, God is unfit, and His tyranny is keeping us from the true freedom we could have!"; that is the collective manifesto of mankind, and because of it, the blood of our brothers cries out from the ground. 

To those nations who acknowledge God in truth, He grants soundness of mind, and a soul which conforms to His will over theirs. For the great majority of the masses to be repentant, and for them to deny their own sinful wills, and for the Gospel to be exalted and proclaimed in every heart, in every pulpit, and in every marketplace, that is what it means for a nation to be Christian. Such a nation is awakened to their sorry state before God, and falls before Him in sackcloth and ashes to receive the forgiveness and grace which is in Jesus Christ. Such a nation honors Him as King, from the lowest peasant to the highest civil magistrate, and both conduct their lives in the context of His grace and His wrath, knowing that judgement befalls evildoing, and the righteous share in rich blessings. To them, God's Law is the standard for Civil Law, and its principles are sanctified above the opinion of any man, or any group of men. The only appropriate deliberation which may be made about right and wrong must be done with respect to the application of the principles of right and wrong, which have already been enumerated in God's word, to specific circumstances in the world. A Christian society does not deliberate democratically over the nature of good and evil.

We do not live in such a nation. Unsurprisingly, the social adoption of subjectivism in the later half of the 20th century only served to add fuel to the fire of progressivism, a movement which began in the late 19th century. The progressives dismiss with the conservative view that government is an entity dedicated to the protection of the people, in favor of the view that government is an entity which engages in social manipulation. 

To those who deny God, their end is a depraved mind, a mind which does not acknowledge Him as King, nor have any regard for truth or righteousness. Watch the skies, like a man who tends the land, or a man who navigates the sea: when the intelligence of the nation fades to madness, and lies are preferred to the truth, and sexual promiscuity abounds, and heresy is preached from the pulpit, and men marry men, and babies are killed in the womb, and the freedoms of the citizens are slowly erased from their Constitution, you are right to conclude that the nation has fallen under God's judgement. This is the secular nation, ruled by the deviant and sinful desires of men, with no checks and balances, and no objective accountability to anyone other than whoever holds the keys of political power at that time. 

We might be tempted to think that such a nation would be restored through the acquisition and the exercise of political power by a small part of usurpers, as the Groypers under Nick Fuentes have attempted to do. Or, perhaps we would be tempted to remove ourselves from politics at all, as most of the evangelical church has chosen to do, and direct our energies elsewhere. Both are unequivocally the wrong response. The first is a flawed approach, and might I add, quite a Roman Catholic response to the problem of secularism. One only needs to examine the history of the Catholics breifly to discover that despicable men have risen to the ranks of Pope and Bishop with ease, and executed deprave actions while they represented the Roman Church. It is one thing to elect a wolf, it is another to elect a sheep who will be torn apart by the other wolves, and another entirely elect a severely vicious wolf who looks like a sheep.
