_"But deep in the darkness is God..." ~ Rilke_

In our quest for knowledge, we assume that all things which are true are knowable.

No doubt we have Rationalism to blame for this belief. In most cases, it is a necessary assumption that must be made before embarking on a scientific or philosophical quest for truth. The journey must begin in some capacity before the feasibility of reaching the end destination can be evaluated; "how might we get there?" is a better question, epistemologically, than "can we arrive at all?". And of course, Man's insatiable ambition and curiosity often preclude the latter question automatically, not by means of reason, but by means of passion. Man is more likely to keep attempting to lead a horse to water after it has been long dead than to step back and consider the vitality of the horse.

No doubt, this ambition is what we have to thank for many of the blessings that we enjoy in our daily lives. The drive, creativity, and effort of many scientists, philosophers, artists, entrepreneurs, engineers, and so on, has lead the intellectual and technological charge of progress into history. The tenacity that exists within each person to one degree or another which refuses to back down from an aspiration until it has been summitted is the engine of this progress.

It is easy, therefore, for post-industrialism post-enlightenment inhabitants of society to relegate all the phenomena of being to the category of "knowable". Having been conditioned to seek explanation for things which are not understood, and having historically found satisfactory explanation for those things, we conclude inductively that all phenomena which we could seek to explain are, indeed, explainable. Man no longer gazes at the night sky in complete ignorance, awe, and wonder, nor does he marvel at the boundary established to keep the ocean distinct from the land, nor the ability for a bird to travel through the air using the effort of its wings. He is content to observe these things and use the explanations of science he learned in his education to provide a convincing case for why these things should be so. "Of course the sea should not go up onto the land, for Newton's Law of Gravitation causes it to remain in the well of the seabed", as if providing that explanation to a single "why" did not, in the process of the explanation, give life to dozens more "whys" in the mind of the student. Science marches on in the manner of recursive explanation, seeking to explain the current explanations or to reject them in favor of better ones. Mystery occupies no more space in the mind of Rationalistic Man than what is necessary to facilitate the process of wrestling with what the next explanation should be. This is not to say that there isn't a great deal of mystery in the world, but the quality of the mysterious has been tamed and diluted by the hubris of the rationalistic mind, and its constant self-consolation that all things can be known in due time.

It is no wonder we search for meaning the way we do. Mystery has been too domesticated to satisfy man's appetite for the truly wild.

It would be temping to conclude that we know too much; that we are living in a version of Neitzche's Hell: mystery is dead, and science has killed it. What pride we have! The problem is not knowing too much, it is knowing too much to be humble and too little to appreciate the magnitude of what there is to know!

Here is where we turn to mathematics, my field of expertise, though I use that word lightly. Mathematics is known by laymen for its precision, less so for its predictive power, and even less so for its role as the foundation of the natural sciences. For whatever we claim to know about the world, we use mathematics to explain it. Nothing could seem less unexplainable or unknowable than mathematics.

And yet, mathematics is a double edged sword. It was thought at one time that everything in mathematics could be proved; that all true mathematical statements, even the ones which have not been discovered yet, could be proved to be true at some point with enough time and effort. Many early 20th century mathematicians and philosophers sought to accomplish this task, or at least embodied the rationalistic spirit to do so. Notably, Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead embarked on this very task in the _Principia Mathematica_, which would be an all-inclusive and monolithic work of mathematics as a whole; every proof for every truth of math. Mathematical mystery would, for all history thereafter, occupy the grave.

Stunningly, a young mathematician named Kurt Godel published a theorem which he called, humbly, "Theorem IV". He had discovered that mathematics, and indeed any kind of mathematics, was Incomplete: there would, for any system of axioms, always be statements which were true, and yet not provable or knowable, forever undomesticating mathematical mystery.
