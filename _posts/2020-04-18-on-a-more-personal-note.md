Ordinarily I don't find it very productive to write in the first person. A piece centered around "I think" and "in my opinion" loses its persuasive power, having been relegated to the domain of opinion. Indeed I have used, and will continue to use phrases which denote that a subsequent thought is merely my opinion, but I'm not interested in writing Op-Eds. The realm of conjecture and preference is one I engage in with close friends, over a pint in a downtown pub. I prefer my prose to that which I have thoroughly considered; a well-considered and plausible hypothesis, or an enumeration of truths which are, to me, inescapable. There have been many things which I have written which I have decided not to publish for this reason. If I am to write, I am to write about things as they are, as God says that they are, as if their consequences and ontology had no bearing on a dysfunctional man like myself, who battles his own afflictions and falls to his own temptations. A cracked pipe can still carry some water, if the pressure is high enough. 

Beaurocratically enforced quarantine has a way of revealing the contents of the soul.
