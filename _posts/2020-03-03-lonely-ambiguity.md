With empty strength <br>
Grievous branches fracture the sky <br>
To murmur warnings. <br>

<br>

Mankind sighs like the trees <br>
As he wistfully sojourns for all of his lifeless days. <br>
Even in the grave his ache is not soothed. <br>

<br>

Where is man's home? <br>
The whole world groans: <br>
"Not here, and not there either". <br>
