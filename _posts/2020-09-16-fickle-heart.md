Why did you die for me, my Lord?

What benefit do I bring to You?

What do I have to offer but sin, selfishness, and unholiness?

What am I, in my natural state, but dishonor to Your name?

My whole life, apart from you, is blasphemy.

I am a rotten soul, fit for the waste pile.

Sheol is the place where I belong, but you have placed me in the land of the living.

Why justify a sinner? What do you gain from that?

Why make him, while yet in his iniquity against You, your beloved son?

Why humiliate Yourself, for the sake of one who hated you?

My sin is great; my whole life weighs upon my conscience like great iron chains.

How bitterly I weep, and long to truly love You.

How I long to be truly anything at all.
