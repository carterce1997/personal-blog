It's the day before the election, and most of what has needed to be said has been said by many men and women who are far more sophisticated, nuanced, and articulate than I am. In my mind, a vote for Biden is a vote for abortion, socialism, and  social justice. The Bible is clear on these things: abortion is murder, socialism is theft, and social justice is partiality. A vote for Trump is not a vote for those things, hence, I slept like a baby (well...I guess I slept as well as I normally sleep) after casting my early ballot for him last Friday.

Get two things straight. First, this election is not about voting for your next pastor. No one is arguing that Trump has good character, and the people who are telling you to vote for him based on his character are just as na√Øve and disillusioned as the people who are telling you to vote for Joe Biden based on his character. I'll just leave this [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcpX2wYUr88&ab_channel=CBSEveningNews). #BelieveAllWomen (or is that against the rules if the perp is Joe Biden and the victim the daughter of a Democrat? I'm a little confused). It's silly to think that this is an election whose stakes are the moral character of the candidate elect.
