Human religion is designed to be paletable to man. Islam, Bhuddism, Hinduism, Mormonism, Judaism, Paganism, Atheism, and all other world religions except for Christianity have the same *soteriology*. Man, with his reason and his conscience awakened, recognizes in a very general way his own need to be "saved". Some seek this salvation through works, and seek to align their behavior with a moral code expounded in a religious text, as the Muslims and the Jews and the Mormons do. Others seek to transcend themselves through meditation or spiritual awakening, as the Bhuddists do. Still others seek salvation through intellectual and moral fulfillment, or the acquisition of power, or romance, or sensual pleasure. Even the most ardent rock-ribbed atheists describe their atheistic conversion using soteriological language. Richard Dawkins all but describes education in Neo-Darwinian Evolution with religious sanctity when he says, "Although atheism might have been *logically* tenable before Darwin, Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist". His zealous contemporary Neil DeGrasse Tyson, a prominent modern evangelist of scientism, appears to even proclaim an atheistic gospel of the cosmological origins of matter when he says, "I know that the molecules in my body are traceable to phenomena in the cosmos. That makes me want to grab people on the street and say: â€˜Have you HEARD THIS?'".

Human beings cannot bear to live in a soteriological vacuum. We can infer from our religious tendencies that we seek to be saved, and if we find no means by which we can be delivered from our current state, we will engineer one to our liking.

Biblical Christianity does not offer mankind a salvation that they play any part in. Of works, it says, "you can never work hard enough to be good enough". Of platitudes, it says, "the wisdom of man is foolishness". Of education, it says, "you will either pass on what you know to a fool, or you will die with what you know". Of experience, it says, "you are blind". Of worshipping nature, it says "even nature groans to be renewed".
