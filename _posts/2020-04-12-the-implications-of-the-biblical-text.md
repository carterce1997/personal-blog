The archetype of salvation, that is, of rebirth, regeneration, deliverance from evil, transcendence, etc. is a ubiquitous element of every culture regardless of its religious background. Some men seek this salvation through works, and strive to align their behavior with some moral code expounded in a religious text. Others seek to transcend themselves through meditation or spiritual awakening. Still others will devote their lives and their intellects to sociopolitical advancement, such as communism, socialism, environmentalism, or neo-conservatism. Many seek salvation through intellectual and moral fulfillment, or the acquisition of power, or romance, or sensual pleasure. Even the most ardent rock-ribbed atheists describe their atheistic conversion using soteriological language. Richard Dawkins, author of *The God Delusion*, grants Neo-Darwinian Evolution religious sanctity when he says, "Although atheism might have been *logically* tenable before Darwin, Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist". His contemporary Neil DeGrasse Tyson, well-known evangelist of scientism and a staunch skeptic of theism, proclaims the wonders of the cosmological origins of matter with something more akin to religious zeal than scientific curiosity when he says, "I know that the molecules in my body are traceable to phenomena in the cosmos. That makes me want to grab people on the street and say: â€˜Have you HEARD THIS?'".

We cannot bear to live in a soteriological vacuum. If we find no means to be saved, we will engineer one ourselves.

Biblical Christianity stands in stark contrast to all the other religions of the world. It does not offer mankind a salvation that they play any part in. Of being a good person, it says, "you can never work hard enough to be good enough". Of platitudes and philosophy, it says, "the wisdom of man is foolishness". Of education, it says, "you will either pass on what you know to a fool, or you will die with what you know". Of enlightening experiences, it says, "you are blind". Of scientism, it says, "even nature itself groans to be renewed, like man does". Of finding yourself, it says, "you are lost". Of politics, and social revolution, it says "God is the only just King." If you want a religion that gives you little pleasures, puts you at ease with your own goodness, or gives you the satisfaction of believing that your own good works are enough for you to go to heaven, forget about Christianity.

What Christianity offers to our afflicted consciences is not moralism, but a man who claimed to be God, who was tortured and hung on a cross, and who rose from the dead and ascended into Heaven. It confounds the intelligence of the philosophers by trading discourse and principle for eternal communion with an eternal Person. It exhausts the efforts of the moralists and cuts them at the knees in their pride, by demanding a standard of perfection. The claims of Biblical Scripture to not allow an intellectually honest person to conclude that Christianity can be reduced to moralism, or that Jesus was a merely a wise ethical teacher, or that his death was merely a symbolic act, or that his resurrection was a manufactured legend like the story of the Phoenix. If you hold to Biblical text, you have no room for these conclusions. You must either reject the whole thing as the ramblings of insanity, and conclude that the man Jesus of Nazareth was the most despicable lunatic who ever walked the face of the earth, or you must accept it in its entirety as truth, and worship Jesus as the God he claims to be.
