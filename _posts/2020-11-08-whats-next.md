Keeping it quick (it is the Sabbath, after all), but here are some snappy _Pens√©es_, in [the spirit of the month](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBEnaNOFMR8&ab_channel=CanonPress):

Be wary of using current events to inform your eschatological positions. That's foolish.

Trusting God necessitates acting wisely, in preparation for the future. It might be a good idea to anticipate lockdowns and general long-term civil unrest, what with the whole ["Great Reset"](https://greatreset.com/) thing. If you needed another indication beyond abortion and socialism that the Left is fundamentally opposed to human flourishing, you should read about it.

I don't think anything is going to come of the litigation storm we are currently in. What I mean is, I don't think the election is going to flip, even if some lawsuits are won. I'm living my life as if Biden (Harris) is going to be president in January. There are people whose job it is to collect evidence, report it, examine it, and bring justice to wrongdoers; I'm not one of them. I'm just a farm kid who deals with worldview issues.

Be prepared for [the "Equality Act"](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/5/text) to be rammed down your throat shortly after Biden (Harris) is sworn in. It's a short read. The Act would probably be used as grounds for calling preaching "illegal hate speech", and most certainly as grounds for imprisonment of a pastor who counsels a person struggling with homosexual desires to repent from them and not gratify their flesh (on the basis that such counsel would fall under "conversion therapy"), or as grounds for shutting down a church if they refused to hire a gay pastor, among other things. Fundamentally, it might be the end of Christian organizations as a whole. Oh by the way, it's already passed the House. Anticipate an executive order; they're fashionable right now.

Democrats today ain't what they used to be. Gone are the days of the JFK Democrat. Most Democrats are Leftists; they oppose the principles this Republic was founded on and they oppose Christianity, since the two go hand-in-hand. Most OG Democrats agreed with Republicans that the founding principles of this country were mostly good. Not so anymore.

Democrat Christians are hypocrites. Hypocrisy is a sin. On Sunday, they said they love the God who says _"do not murder"_ and _"do not steal"_, and on Tuesday, they voted for the party of abortion and socialism.

All that said, there's no room for despair as a Christian. No room. No despair, no fear, no panic, no distress, none of it. Why? Read your Bible.

_P.S._ If you're wondering...I named these "The Benedictine Diaries" because I have an old bottle I dug out of my buddy's backyard in high school when we were clearing space for his new sugarhouse. I later turned into a lamp that sits on my desk. It's a long story. It says "Benedictine" on it, and I needed a tag for my more informal blog posts.
