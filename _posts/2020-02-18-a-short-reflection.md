I have walked with Christ for eight years.

<br>

Eight years ago I heard the gospel preached, plainly, in an early morning bible study held by a handful of students in a small conference room at my high school. All at once, the yearning I had to know God and to be right with Him was satisfied; I knew at once that Christ had died for my sins, and that He was raised from the dead so I could live with Him forever. I knew that no matter what happened for the rest of my life, I would be counted as righteous before Him, not because of my good deeds, but because of Him.

<br>

Walking with God for one year, eight years, or fifty years is not a testimony of individual will or dedication. The means of steady faith could not be further from individual will or dedication. What I regard of the past eight years is not my own ability to persevere, but my inability. Within my natural self is nothing but dysfunction, but my life is bolstered by the hand of God at every moment as He renews my mind, directs me, and guides my decisions. He changes me and places people in my life to admonish me in doctrine, conduct, and grace. His grace covers all of my failures and gives me all of my successes.
