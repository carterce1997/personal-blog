In some ways, the timing of this post couldn't be worse. Gym equipment is hard to come by, and with the second wave of the Chinese virus rearing its head, our benevolent and illustrious civil magistrates are going to start mandating lockdowns soon. But, I'm the editor and chief author here, and sometimes I like to take a break from writing about theology and politics.

In reality, this isn't really a break from writing about theology and politics. For one, I should probably stop saying "theology _and_ politics", because a person's politics are a consequence of their theology; a neo-Darwinian atheistic worldview will _necessarily_ advocate for a kind of political policy and administration looks different than the Muslim stuff or the Christian stuff. That's a point I've put enough beating into to kill, but I'll have to address it later in some capacity I'm sure.

If you believe, as I do, that the Gospel is much more than the neat little "Jesus died for your sins" package, and that the whole things grows and extends and rules over all areas of life, from art, to engineering, to politics, to sex, then you'll concede that my purpose in writing an article outlining how to make the human body stronger and more capable is a Gospel issue. It's not the issue I'm going to deal with foremost in someone's life if I'm evangelizing (I'll deal with the issues of sin and repentance and faith first), but the whole process Christian maturation eventually ought to encompass dealing with the issues of later priority. One of those issues is the idea of anthropological purpose and flourishing. What does it mean to be human? Well, it means that you are the image of God; you are either a man or a woman by nature of your God-given biology, created for God's glory. There's enough in that idea for a whole book.

In this article, I'm going to deal with what it means to be a man, 1) because I am a man, and 2) because the idea of true masculinity has been trodden on for decades now. Real, Biblical masculinity is Christlike. Men ought to be like Christ. They ought to be holy, capable, bold, and willing to say or to do whatever needs to be done. The idea of Jesus as portrayed on Mormon pamphlets as a silky-handed shampoo model caressing a lamb and speaking in tender vocal-fry about "loving your neighbor by wearing a mask" does not comport with the Biblical Jesus who drove evil men out of the Temple with a cord of whips, called Peter a spokesperson for Satan, accused the Pharisees of being children of the Devil, and gave hellfire sermons that would make Jonathan Edwards blush. And lest you be tempted to forget the God of the whole Bible, let us be reminded of the nations of old that God justly crushed under the Israelites in the Old Testament, or the fact that Christ will return at His second advent upon as a Warrior-King to make war with evil itself. If you think Jesus is an effeminate "nice guy", you are either ignorant (because you don't know the Scriptures), a heretic (because you think Jesus has a different nature than God Himself), or a hypocrite (because you're a Christian third-wave feminist).

Effeminate men are not Christlike, because effeminate men don't have what it takes to conquer the world and rule it with Christ.

The West is dealing with crisis shortage of true masculinity. True masculinity is Christlike; it's sharp, capable, honest, pure, holy, tender when necessary, brutal when needed. It's the kind of stuff that's able to conquer the world. Moreover, it's the kind of stuff that takes practice. Our dualistic and sedentary methods of philosophy, which we no-doubt inherited from the Greeks, lead us to believe that we can cultivate masculine virtue by thinking alone, not realizing that the mind must be trained in holiness, not merely educated in it. If a man can deadlift 405, that immediately tells me something about his intangible faculties. Specifically, that he is confident, well-acquainted with doing hard things, and disciplined. I understand that he is not only _currently_ useful as a result of the strength he has accumulated in his body, but that he also understands the process by which a man is _made_ useful in other disciplines. In other words, the development of the physical virtue of strength has aided in the development of some spiritual virtues too. As strength coach Mark Rippetoe says, "when the body gets stronger, everything else gets stronger too".

Masculinity has had a long relationship with physical strength and competence throughout human history. It's sad that this connection must be explained. Men are biologically designed to be stronger and more aggressive than women due to the amount of testosterone in their hormonal makeup. The male pelvis is more suited for power production, sprinting, lifting, jumping, and lifting heavy weights. The male shoulder girdle is broader and contains more muscle mass than the female counterpart for the sake of punching, lifting, and throwing. The male psychology is more naturally disposed towards aggression, fighting, risk-taking, and disagreeableness than the female psychology. All of these qualities are correlated in development; a more mature body goes along with a more mature mind. Many cultures (unlike ours) have actually valued and encouraged the development of these attributes in men. Because of this, it was important for them to institute rites of passage for older boys who sought to enter society as young men. The Aborigines and the Native Americans tested the metal of young men by some version of a solo "walkabout". Other groups, like Scottish clans, had physical challenges for their boys, like lifting "manhood stones", broad jumps, and other efforts of will.

Strength training has personally benefited me by teaching me discipline, humility, confidence, and mental toughness. God has really used it to sanctify me in my life, not only as a direct means of developing virtue, but also as a pattern for taking on other challenges. Consistently training hard in college turned a low-confidence, prideful, angry, bitter kid like me into someone who has a bit more of a handle on those vices. I know what I'm talking about. I've squatted 465, bench pressed 330, deadlifted 385, pressed (overhead) 225, power cleaned 300, and a few weeks ago I power snatched 230, all at around a bodyweight of 200 (those are pounds, for you non-Americans). I'm not a big guy, and those kinds of numbers aren't world class by any means, but they don't exactly happen by accident.

Now, for the meat of it. In my opinion, a strength program needs to be built around the squat. It is the first movement I teach, and it's the movement I never skip. Strong legs, hips, and a strong back are foundational to any endeavor. Most men make the mistake of neglecting the squat and just doing the bench press, because the bench press is easy. Easy doesn't work.

Besides the squat, there are five other main lifts which must be learned and trained. They are the press, the deadlift, the bench press, the power clean, and the power snatch. These six comprise a complete strength regimen, and the neglect of any one of them is a deficiency. The squat trains the hips and legs and back, the press trains the arms and shoulders, the deadlift trains the back, the bench press trains the triceps and the pectorals, and the power clean and power snatch train explosive power production. A three day per week schedule is best. Squatting, pressing, and pulling will occur every day, with pressing and pulling alternating between the different lifts. For example,

Monday
Squat 3 x 5
Press or Bench 3 x 5
Deadlift 1 x 5

Wednesday
Squat 3 x 5
Bench or Press 3 x 5
Power Clean or Power Snatch 5 x 1-2

Friday
Squat 3 x 5
Press or Bench 3 x 5
Deadlift 1 x 5

Each time a lift is trained, the weight on the bar will go up by 5 to 10 lbs. By progressively overloading in this way, we allow the body to continue to adapt to the increasing stress. The details of this program are on the [Starting Strength](https://startingstrength.com/) website.
