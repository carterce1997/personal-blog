A number of years ago, pastor John MacArthur stated in a panel forum with R.C. Sproul and other contemporary Reformed pastors that Christianity in America has "spiritual AIDS; it could die of a thousand heresies". No doubt, the church has gone to the dogs many times in history. The dogs of our day are the usual suspects: the secularists, the Marxists, the socialists, the woke, the critical race theorists, the social justice advocates, the hypochondriacs, the sexual revolutionaries, and so on. The Western church is ill-equipped to handle these threats, being more concerned with platitudes than principles, inundated with emotionalism, starved of piety, ignorant of both God's law and gospel, famished for lack of Biblical preaching, obsessed with appearance and palatability, and promiscuous with the worldliness she is meant to oppose.

Dr. Glenn Sunshine's book _Slaying Leviathan_ attempts to equip Christians to face these challenges. The goal of his book is to provide a concise historical account of political theory and resistance in the Christian tradition. Sunshine is a talented historian and a devout Reformed Presbyterian, and he has a talent for not only distilling complex historical events, but also for explaining how these events interacted with issues of worldview. _Slaying Leviathan_ is a comprehensive summary of the development of the ideas of limited government and resistance from the early church through to the founding of the United States of America. It is highly approachable even for lay readers who are not acquainted with church history or political theory.
