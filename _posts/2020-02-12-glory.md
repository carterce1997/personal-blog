From within, I am overcome <br>
Your glory crushes me <br>
I watch the stars worship You <br>
And I hear the stones sing Your praises <br>

<br>

But when I look for You, my eyes are glass
My ears are filled with cement <br>
Longing grips my chest <br>
And sorrow fills my bones with ache <br>

<br>

I am superfluous

<br>

Yet You carry me, <br>
My Father <br>
You heal me, <br>
My First Love <br>

<br>

That is the greatest mystery to me. <br>
