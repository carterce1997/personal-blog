<p>Unapologetics: a play on the word <em>unapologetic</em>, meaning put forth without qualification, and the word <em>apologetics</em>, based on the Greek <em>apologia</em>, meaning a systematic argumentative discourse in defense of an idea.</p>

<p>How a society sees Christ dictates everything about it, just as how a person sees Christ dictates everything about they way they live. If Christ reigns supreme over all of life, then politics, economics, family life, romance, technology, science, and society will look a certain way. If He does not, then they will look a very different way. The Christendom and the Secular Kingdom are founded on entirely different axioms, rendering them fundamentally incompatible. In the former, life is lived <em>coram deo</em>, ‚Äúbefore God‚Äù, and in the latter, accountability must be engineered from a vacuum of nihilism.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>My intention is to keep the topic of this blog broad. I contend one thing: that Christ reigns supreme over all of life.</p>

<p>My name is Chris Carter, and I‚Äôm not much more than a layman with a conviction to write. I‚Äôve been told that my prose is straightforward, to the point, and unapologetic.</p>
