I"è<p>I love Blaise Pascal‚Äôs <em>Pensees</em>. It‚Äôs a collection of theological and philosophical meditations with the kind of succinctness, curtness, bite, and obduration to them that‚Äôs wholly missing in most philosophy and almost all contemporary evangelicalism. Pascal  was a mathematician, a physicist, an inventor, and a theologian. He writes like all of those things. Mathematicians and physicists have a particular way of speaking that is simultaneously very succinct and very thorough. I, personally, find many philosophers and theologians to be too wordy; Pascal is a breath of fresh air. Consider this:</p>

<p><em>Vanity.</em> The cause and effect of love. Cleopatra. (<em>Pensees 46</em>)</p>

<p>In one fragment, he has discussed an entire claim and provided a proof of it with a single word. Lovely!</p>

<p>Men should understand poetry as a tool of rhetoric. It has a place in the persuasion of the masses, the ventures of business, and the wooing of women. That said, men don‚Äôt direct other men towards practical matters of conduct and character through poetry. At least, they ought not to. Men are glad to listen to other men when they are direct, clear, and unapologetic, as statements with these qualities signify urgency, trust, and importance to the listener.</p>

<p>Modern evangelicalism has followed the world in becoming a culture known for a style of communication that is soft, indirect, and vague. As such, it is wholly unappealing to most men except the most feminine among them, and feminine men are both useless as men and useless as women. Speak directly, clearly, and with authority, and men will listen to you and challenge your ideas.</p>
