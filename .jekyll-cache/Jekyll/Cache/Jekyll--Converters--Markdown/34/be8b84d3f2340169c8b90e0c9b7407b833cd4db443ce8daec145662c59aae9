I"ç<p>From within, I am overcome <br />
Your glory crushes me <br />
I watch the stars worship You <br />
And I hear the stones sing Your praises <br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>But my eyes are glass <br />
My ears are filled with cement <br />
Loneliness grips my chest <br />
And sorrow fills my bones with ache <br />
My song is halfhearted <br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I am superfluous <br /></p>
