I"<p>One day towards the end of my junior year of college, I took some time in between classes to run some errands I had been putting off. I went, as I normally did at the end of a semester, to the UPS store to return the textbooks I had rented for the semester’s academic affairs. While I was waiting for my books to be processed by the woman behind the counter, I struck up a conversation with an old fellow behind me. At some point the conversation turned from what I did (“well, I study math at Clarkson”) and what my aspirations were (“honestly I’m just looking forward to graduation”), to a bit of ecclesiological storytelling, as older men often like to impart of bit of passing wisdom off to younger men. I think it helps them to feel young again, and Lord knows we need all the wisdom we can get. “I was in the Navy for a time”, he began, as a preamble to the stories he subsequently told me of all the places he lived and the things that he did. “And through it all, I’ve always considered my life to be an adventure.”</p>
