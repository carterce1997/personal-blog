I"[<p>It’s well-known that America is a divided nation. There are essentially two worldviews, denoted by “the Right” and “the Left”. The Right takes the tenets of its worldview from, roughly, Christianity (although the Right is more and more resembling what the Left was a few decades ago). Up until very recently, we didn’t know what the epistemological and moral underpinnings of the Left were. We knew it was something do to with Socialist and Marxist ideas, but the heavy emphasis on race and racial inequality didn’t quite fit the bill for either of those. Critical Race Theory fits the shoe.</p>

<p>Richard Delgado (a CRT professor at University of Alabama School of Law) lists the following themes of CRT in his book <em>Critical Race Theory: An Introduction</em> (bear with the jargon, philosophers have a habit of not saying what they mean, and using too many words to describe a simple idea):</p>

<h2 id="interest-convergence-material-determinism-and-racial-realism">Interest Convergence, Material Determinism, and Racial Realism</h2>

<p>Interest Convergence is the convergence of the interests of the oppressing and oppressed classes for the sake of the oppressing class. The example given is in 1954 when the Supreme Court established that segregation in schools was unconstitutional in <em>Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka</em>. CRT argues that this was done to ease racial tensions and quell the threat of widespread domestic unrest following the Korean War and WW2 and in order to present a more united front for the Cold War, not out of a societal desire for racial equality. Racial Realism is another term, which argues that racism arises as “a means by which society allocates privilege and status”, as opposed to matters of thinking, discourse, and perception. CRT argues this by means of Material Determinism, the concept that racism is a tool to demonize conquered nations in order to acquire material gains, such as land or slaves. Under CRT, Racial Realism is the “what” of racism, and Material Determinism is the “why” of it.</p>

<h2 id="revisionist-history">Revisionist History</h2>

<p>CRT strongly advocates for a reexamination of America’s history by “replacing comforting majoritarian interpretations of events with ones that square more accurately with minorities’ experiences”.</p>

<h2 id="critique-of-liberalism">Critique of Liberalism</h2>

<p>CRT has lost faith that Liberalism is an effective engine of social change, and places strong criticism against Liberal notions of equality and justice, such as color blindness, role modeling, the merit principle, and other “neutral principles of constitutional law”. They believe these things are ineffective for bringing about true equality, and merely gloss over the real issues. CRT is also incredibly skeptical of the Liberal notion of rights, their quarrel being that most “rights” are merely rights to a procedure (e.g. right to start a business, right to freedom of speech) rather than rights to a certain outcome (e.g. right to a salary, right not to hear hate speech).</p>

<h2 id="structural-determinism">Structural Determinism</h2>

<p>CRT argues that the structure of language itself can be a system of oppression. Structural Determinism is “the idea that our system, by reason of its structure and vocabulary, cannot redress certain types of wrong”. Language, under CRT, is fundamentally limited; like a color palette which is artificially limited to paint a picture of reality, CRT asserts that English itself contains only one word for “racism”, but a myriad of ways to express “hate speech”.</p>

<h2 id="other-miscellaneous">Other Miscellaneous</h2>

<p>CRT also upholds a judicial calculus based on Essentialism and Intersectional Theory, which assign varying levels of oppressor/oppressed status to people groups based on gender, race, sexuality, and other categories.</p>
