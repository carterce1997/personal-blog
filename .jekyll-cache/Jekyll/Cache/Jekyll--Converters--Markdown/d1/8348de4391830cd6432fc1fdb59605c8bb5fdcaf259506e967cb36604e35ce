<p>How a person sees Christ dictates everything about they way they live. If Christ reigns supreme over all of life, then politics, economics, family life, romance, technology, science, physical fitness, and all other manner of human experience will look a certain way. Conversely, if He does not, then they will look a very different way. The Christendom and the Anti-Christendom are founded on entirely different axioms, which render them fundamentally incompatible. Christian life in the Christendom is lived <em>coram deo</em>, “before God”. Those in the Anti-Christendom are not merely apathetic towards obedience to God; they are fundamentally opposed to Him and to His rule over the whole Universe, and with respect to society must engineer a framework of accountability and morality from a vacuum of nihilism using sinful and selfish reasoning.</p>

<p>My intention is to keep the topic of this blog broad. I contend that Christ reigns supreme over all of life, having purchased redemption from sins by His blood; a statement which is true, which must be contended for (both in the marketplace and the soul), and which does not need to be qualified.</p>

<p>My name is Chris Carter. In general, my life can be categorized into roughly three categories: physical culture, mathematical sciences, and applied theology. I’m not much more than a layman with a conviction to write in a straightforward manner about the nature of God, the world, and man, so that is what I do.</p>
