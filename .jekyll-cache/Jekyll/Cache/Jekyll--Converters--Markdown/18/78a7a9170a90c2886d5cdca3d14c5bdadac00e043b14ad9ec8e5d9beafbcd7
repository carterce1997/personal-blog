I"e<p>It’s well-known that America is a divided nation. There are essentially two worldviews, denoted by “the Right” and “the Left”. The Right takes the tenets of its worldview from, roughly, Christianity (although the Right is more and more resembling what the Left was a few decades ago). Up until very recently, we didn’t know what the epistemological and moral underpinnings of the Left were. We knew it was something do to with Socialist and Marxist ideas, but the heavy emphasis on race and racial inequality didn’t quite fit the bill for either of those. Critical Race Theory fits the shoe.</p>
