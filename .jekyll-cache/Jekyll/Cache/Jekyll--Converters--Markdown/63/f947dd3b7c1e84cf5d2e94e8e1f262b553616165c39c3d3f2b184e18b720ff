I"X<p>I still donâ€™t know why Jesus was crucified for me. The cross is one of those things that, as I behold, becomes more and more profound to me. The Law of Sin is easy to understand, and the manner of a sinful world is easy to comprehend, if you start with the axiom that men hate God, are desperately selfish, and are profoundly dissatisfied with the created order. To say that all of human history is a trivial deduction from these axioms is overstating the claim, but human behavior becomes a lot less complicated to understand if these things are the origin of the analysis. Tyranny, deception, murder, rape, theft, and the rest of the like, are all too familiar to us. Not only do we read of them in the news, and not only do we receive these things from others, but within our very bones lie the same lusts which drive men to commit these acts.</p>
