I"Š<p>Itâ€™s often the case with any discussion of ideas, that the definition of terms serves as a stumbling block to productive conversation. Iâ€™ve found that â€œwhat exactly do you mean?â€ or â€œwhat exactly are you asking?â€ are two of the most helpful questions in any discussion. To the end of attempting to live at peace with all men, we ought to be sure that we know what they are saying, first. Thus, when it comes to the question â€œdo you support feminism?â€ in the absence of any context, my response is almost surely â€œit depends what you mean by feminismâ€. I am not an ideologue who merely opposes or supports anything attached to a particular word. If you were to ask me if I supported â€œsocial justiceâ€, my answer would most likely be â€œnoâ€, but I would refrain from giving a definite answer until I was sure I understood what was meant by â€œsocial justiceâ€ in the mind of the person I was speaking with. If they meant â€œa Marxist definition of justiceâ€, my original answer would stand, but if they meant â€œlimited structures of socialized support for those who have fallen on hard timesâ€, I could probably get behind that.</p>
