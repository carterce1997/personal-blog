<p>How a person sees Christ dictates everything about they way they live. If Christ reigns supreme over all of life, then politics, economics, family life, romance, technology, science, physical fitness, and all other manner of human experience will look a certain way. Conversely, if He does not, then they will look a very different way. We are a world of two kingdoms, the Christendom and the Anti-Christendom, and they are founded on entirely different axioms which render them fundamentally incompatible. Life in the Christendom is lived <em>coram deo</em>, while the Anti-Christendom holds opposition to God as axiomatic to citizenship. The latter is the natural state of man, into which all men are born. At one time, the West cherished the principles of the Christendom, but those with an eye on the times feel instinctually that it is only a matter of time before the floor beneath the feet of the West erodes enough to give way. Friedrich Nietzsche was not celebrating when he said ‚ÄúGod is dead‚Äù. He was, in that moment, an intellectually honest unbeliever, panicked and burdened by the daunting task of secular society to engineer a framework of accountability and morality from a vacuum of nihilism, sin, and selfish dialectic. He, and many philosophers, are blind enough to actually give it a go.</p>

<p>We have long forgotten that a Christless soul and a Christless nation are fundamentally hopeless, and the damage done by the rejection of the Gospel of Jesus Christ as the fundamental axiom of being itself is something which cannot be fixed by mere Americanist platitudes, nebulous insistence to embrace ‚Äúsocial justice‚Äù, or convictions from moralistic therapeutic deism. The Gospel is the only remedy for the world, as it has always been, and as it shall always be. Thus, my intention is to keep the topic of this blog broad: I contend that Christ reigns supreme over all of life, having purchased redemption from sins and the restoration of all things by His blood.</p>

<p>Oh, my name is Chris Carter, by the way. Evan is my middle name, hence ‚ÄúC.E.‚Äù. If you‚Äôre still using ‚ÄúC.E.‚Äù to denote ‚ÄúCommon Era‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúA.D.‚Äù for <em>anno domini</em> (which means ‚Äúin the year of our Lord‚Äù), you should see to it that you become Christianized.</p>
