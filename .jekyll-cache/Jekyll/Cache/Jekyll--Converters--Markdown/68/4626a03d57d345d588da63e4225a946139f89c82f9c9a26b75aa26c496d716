I"<p>The book of Proverbs, chapter 31, is cited often for its exposition of the qualities of an excellent wife: a woman who is trustworthy, kind, strong, industrious, entrepreneurial, skilled, upright, a master of her household, and God-fearing. The sentiment of her character is summarized in the final verse of the chapter by her husband who proclaims, “Many daughters have done nobly, but you excel them all.” She is nothing short of remarkable; a prime example of the kind of woman a young man seeking to be married should look for.</p>
