I" <p>In their empty beauty and strength <br />
Aching branches fracture the sky <br />
To murmur warnings. <br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Mankind sighs like the trees <br />
As he wistfully sojourns for all of his lifeless days. <br />
Even in the grave his ache is not soothed. <br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Where is manâ€™s home? <br />
The whole world groans: <br />
â€œNot here, and not there eitherâ€. <br /></p>
