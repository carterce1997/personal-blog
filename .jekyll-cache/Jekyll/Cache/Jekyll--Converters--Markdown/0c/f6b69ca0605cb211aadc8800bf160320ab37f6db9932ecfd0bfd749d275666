I"y<p>In general, I think itâ€™s a good idea to have a mostly optimistic demeanor. We are awarded the justification for this attitude in Christ. He rules over all and He has restored the whole world to Himself by His death and resurrection, thus precluding any justification for pessimism even under a staunchly pessimistic eschatology. Christ has already won, amen and amen.</p>
