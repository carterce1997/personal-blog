I"<p>Christians who try to justify voting for the Democratic party often cite a dilemma like this:</p>

<p>“Pro-life people only want to prevent abortions, but don’t want to guarantee healthcare for all.”</p>

<p>And, that’s almost invariably true with a plain reading. What is <em>implied</em> is that there exists a kind of hypocrisy that exists among pro-life people that causes them only to care about unborn life, and not innate life (“born life” is a funny term…hence the avoidance).</p>

<p>It’s vexing to me that I have to explain the fallacy here.</p>

<p>Life is a right. Healthcare and other human flourishing benefits are not rights.</p>

<p>Unborn babies are human beings. Human beings are made in the image of God. Abortion is the termination of the life of an unborn baby; it is the murder of a human life. The murder of human beings is outright prohibited in God’s Law, without exception.</p>

<p><em>You shall not murder.</em> (Exodus 20:13)</p>

<p>Any political party which advocates for murder of any kind is an evil party who seeks to propagate evil, whether it is the Nazi Party, the Bolshevik Party, <em>or the Democratic Party</em>. Period.</p>

<p>Healthcare, by contrast, is not a human right. Healthcare is the product of human labor, namely the labor of doctors, nurses, surgeons, physical therapists, and other healthcare practitioners. You do not have a right to someone else’s labor. If you force their labor, you are stealing from them, and if you fund their labor through taxation, you are stealing from the taxpayer. Stealing is outright prohibited in God’s Law, without exception (even for governments).</p>

<p><em>You shall not steal.</em> (Exodus 20:15)</p>

<p><em>You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his donkey or anything else that belongs to your neighbor.</em> (Exodus 20:17)</p>

<p>(<em>Covet</em> is an old word that means “To feel strong or immoderate desire for that which is another’s.”)</p>
