I"®<p>For the last eight years, I have been walking with Christ.</p>

<p>Eight years ago I heard the gospel preached in an early morning bible study held by a handful of students in a small conference room at my high school. All at once, the yearning I had to know God and to be right with Him was satisfied; I knew at once that Christ had died for my sins, and that He was raised from the dead so I could live with Him forever.</p>
