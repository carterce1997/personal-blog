<p>How a person sees Christ dictates everything about they way they live. If Christ reigns supreme over all of life, then politics, economics, family life, romance, technology, science, physical fitness, and all other manner of human experience will look a certain way. Conversely, if He does not, then they will look a very different way. Furthermore, the Christendom and the Anti-Christendom are founded on entirely different axioms, which render them fundamentally incompatible. Life in the Christendom is lived <em>coram deo</em>, “before God”, while citizens of the Anti-Christendom are not merely apathetic towards obedience to God; they are fundamentally opposed to Him and to His rule over the whole Universe. Friedrich Nietzsche was not celebrating when he said “God is dead”. He was, in that moment, an intellectually honest unbeliever, panicked and burdened by the daunting task of secular society to engineer a framework of accountability and morality from a vacuum of nihilism, sin, and selfish dialectic. Those with an eye on the times feel, instinctually, that it is only a matter of time before the floor beneath the feet of the West erodes enough to give way.</p>

<p>A prophet is not accepted in his hometown, mostly because the people there don’t often like what he has to say. Our society has long forgotten that a Christless soul and a Christless nation are fundamentally hopeless, and the damage done by the rejection of the Gospel of Jesus Christ as the fundamental axiom of being itself is something which cannot be fixed by mere Americanist platitudes. Shouting “freedom of speech” doesn’t work unless your listeners  My intention is to keep the topic of this blog broad. I contend that Christ reigns supreme over all of life, having purchased redemption from sins by His blood; a statement which is true, which must be contended for (both in the marketplace and the soul), and which does not need to be qualified.</p>

<p>My name is Chris Carter. In general, my life can be categorized into roughly three categories: physical culture, mathematical sciences, and applied theology. I’m not much more than a layman with a conviction to write in a straightforward manner about the nature of God, the world, and man, so that is what I do.</p>
