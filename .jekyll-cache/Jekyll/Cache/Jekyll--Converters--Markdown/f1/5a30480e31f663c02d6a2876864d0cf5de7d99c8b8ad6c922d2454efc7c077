I"‘<p>Everyone, at all times in human history, has had a quiet nag in the pit of their stomach that the end of the world is imminent. Post-apocalyptic genres of literature and film play off of that instinct within us. After all, Christians know that one day, the whole show will actually stop: the curtains will be drawn closed and the Author of All Existence will make His appearance on stage, signifying the end to the performance. Even unbelievers know this to be true, though they fail to infer the manner of the end, and erroneously forecast the end of the world by examining current events, or less erroneously conflate the end of some thing in the world with the end of the world itself. No, the true end of the world will be something which cannot be forecast, for our Lord says ‚ÄúI will come like a thief in the night‚Äù and ‚Äúno one knows the day or the hour‚Äù of His appearance. Christians are to anticipate this day, but only insofar as they anticipate an event like their own death, by accounting for it in their day-to-day life without staking any bets on its coming at any particular time. Are you looking to marry, or to invest in a business venture, or to embark on a great project? Do these things not because you are sure of their completion, but as the work which God has given you to accomplish, and don‚Äôt drive yourself mad worrying about what the future holds. Be found working and obedient when He comes, not worrisome or clever. You are not very clever anyway.</p>
