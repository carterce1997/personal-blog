I"ó<p>It seems to me that God gave us 6 days to work and 1 day to rest. The usual argument opposing this is that Christ is our <em>true</em> Sabbath and therefore we don‚Äôt need to observe the Sabbath as Christians today. Yes and amen, Christ is our true Sabbath; we strive no longer in Him. But if we affirm that God‚Äôs 6-1 work/rest split is null and void in the Christian age, what‚Äôs the best way to partition our rest among our work? 7 days on, full throttle? 5 days of work and 2 days of rest, with workday evenings filled with 4 hour periods of hardcore Call of Duty and binge watching Season 2 of The Office in one go? What does ‚Äúrest‚Äù even mean?</p>
