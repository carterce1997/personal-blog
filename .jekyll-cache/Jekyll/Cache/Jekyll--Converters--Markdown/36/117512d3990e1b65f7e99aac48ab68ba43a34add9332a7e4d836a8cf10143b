I"<p>Unapologetics: a play on the word <em>unapologetic</em>, meaning put forth without qualification, and the word <em>apologetics</em>, based on the Greek <em>apologia</em>, meaning a systematic argumentative discourse in defense of an idea.</p>

<p>I affirm, not as a means of opinion, that God is supreme, in all things, at all times, in all endeavors, and in all places. It is only we who do not recognize His supremacy, and from this, we must either be saved by Christ, or perish.</p>
