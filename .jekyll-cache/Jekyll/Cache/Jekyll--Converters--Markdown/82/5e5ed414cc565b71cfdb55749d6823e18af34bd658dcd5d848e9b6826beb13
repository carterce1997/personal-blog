I"ß<p>The crux of the issue of disobeying government is figuring out <em>when</em> disobedience to government is obedience to Christ, and when disobedience to government is disobedience to Christ. One extreme school of thought is that obedience to government is necessary all of the time, and Paul‚Äôs command in Romans 13 to ‚Äúbe in subjection to governing authorities‚Äù is a command for all times and places and situations. This school would have to therefore condemn all civil disobedience as ungodly, including the civil disobedience of the apostles themselves. The opposing extreme argues that obedience to God necessitates that we don‚Äôt consider obedience to government at all, but of course, this view has to deal with pesky problem passages like Romans 13. Ultimately, the nature of the authority structure between God and government is in question. Is human government a pure agent of God‚Äôs governance? Certainly not. Is human government wholly divorced from God‚Äôs governance? Clearly, no.</p>

<p>Romans 13 is often a passage which is cited in support of more obedience to government than less. Specifically, Romans 13:1-7, which says,</p>

<p><em>Every person is to be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God. 2 Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves. 3 For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will have praise from the same; 4 for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil. 5 Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath, but also for conscience‚Äô sake. 6 For because of this you also pay taxes, for rulers are servants of God, devoting themselves to this very thing. 7 Render to all what is due them: tax to whom tax is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.</em></p>

<p>In defense of those who argue for more obedience than less, it‚Äôs easy to try to close the case with the first verse. However, a real problem arises when this passage is used to make a blanket statement that government can do no wrong. No person with a knowledge of history would argue that, but <em>why</em> would they argue that? In order for someone to say that a government is just or unjust requires a standard of morality which exists outside of the government under examination. We may, from the Biblical moral law given in Leviticus, which was expounded upon by our Lord Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount, conclude that the socialist and fascist reign of the Nazi party in Germany was an unjust government, that Stalin‚Äôs rule in the Soviet Union was unjust, and that our own government engages in injustice because it allows for the killing of babies in the womb (among other things). We make these critiques using an <em>external</em> standard of morality, namely the Biblical moral law.</p>

<p>The question which the exegete of this passage must ask is, ‚Äúwhat is the standard of <em>good</em> and <em>evil</em>‚Äù which Paul is referring to when he says ‚ÄúFor rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil‚Äù? Is he appealing to the Roman civil law, or to God‚Äôs moral law? Certainly the latter! How could government be ‚Äúa minister of God‚Äù and ‚Äúservants of God‚Äù if their ministry supposes an entirely different standard of good and evil than God‚Äôs? God is pleased by no standard of good and evil other than His own; any deviation from God‚Äôs standard of good and evil, or any reordering or any poor assignment of goodness or evil, is what sin <em>is</em>. If Paul were referring to the moral standards set by government when he says ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúevil‚Äù, instead of God‚Äôs, he would be under the curse of Isaiah 5:20,</p>

<p><em>Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil; Who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness; Who substitute bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!</em></p>

<p>Government is to be obeyed, not because its rule is the standard for good and evil, but because it is a minister of God‚Äôs standard of good and evil, assigned by God to enforce good and condemn evil according to God‚Äôs law. We not only must obey government</p>
