I"—<p>I love Blaise Pascalâ€™s <em>Pensees</em>. Itâ€™s a collection of theological and philosophical meditations with the kind of succinctness, curtness, bite, and obduration to them thatâ€™s wholly missing in most philosophy and almost all contemporary evangelicalism. Pascal  was a mathematician, a physicist, an inventor, and a theologian. He writes like all of those things. Mathematicians and physicists have a particular way of speaking that is simultaneously very succinct and very thorough. I, personally, find many philosophers and theologians to be too wordy; Pascal is a breath of fresh air. Consider this:</p>

<p><em>Vanity.</em> The cause and effect of love. Cleopatra. (<em>Pensees 46</em>)</p>

<p>In one fragment, he has discussed an entire claim and provided a proof of it with a single word.</p>

<p>Men should understand poetry as a tool of rhetoric. It has a place in the persuasion of the masses, the ventures of business, and the wooing of women. That said, men donâ€™t direct other men towards practical matters of conduct and character through poetry. At least, they ought not to. Men are glad to listen to other men when they are direct, clear, and unapologetic. Statements with these qualities signify urgency and importance to the listener, of course, but more importantly they signify <em>trust</em>. Trust, in that I, the speaker, <em>trust</em> that you, the listener, are competent enough to either take my assertion or challenge it. Flowery and avoidant language signifies a mistrust in the listener, since it hedges for the possibility that he or she is irresponsible, offendable, or otherwise incompetent to handle a conversation about important matters.</p>

<p>Modern evangelicalism has followed the world in becoming a culture known for a style of communication that is soft, indirect, and vague. As such, it is wholly unappealing to most manly men, who desire to be trusted with important matters of practical conduct. Modern evangelicalism serves only to attract men who habitually abdicate responsibility as men. This was noted by Paul Maxwell back in 2018. Speak directly, clearly, and with authority, and men will listen to you and challenge your ideas.</p>
