I"<p>You move beyond my eyes <br />
And speak words beyond my ears <br />
I cannot conceive Your thoughts <br />
Nor can I understand Your ways. <br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I sense You like a thick fog <br />
You envelop me at every place and time <br />
And move my heart either to rejoice <br />
Or to break. <br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Why does solitude wash me with unbearable despair? <br />
Who is closer to me than You? <br />
How indescribably horrible am I <br />
That Your presence isn’t enough for me? <br /></p>
