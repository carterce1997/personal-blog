I"<p>I was fortunate enough during my brief stint on dating apps to meet a nice girl from Canada. We had a lot of great conversations about politics and theology and whatnot, and seemed to connect on a lot of shared values, but unfortunately decided that the wisest thing to do was to not take our relationship further than the friendship we had developed online. A six hour drive to another country isn’t exactly “the girl next door”, and as well, she wasn’t really keen on moving to the United States especially with all of the turmoil our nation is experiencing politically, socially, epidemiologically, economically, and so on. I’m pretty sure she said “ya no way” or something. And, she’s right: the United States is in a state of turmoil right now.</p>
