I"2<p>As an athlete (or at least a hobbyist athlete), I can confirm that being physically injured to the extent that you can’t train sucks. It’s an inevitable reality of pushing yourself in any physical domain that you will <em>eventually</em> get injured somehow. If you don’t get hurt every once in a while, chances are you’re missing out on a lot of performance.</p>

<p>To some, the prospect of getting injured is a strong deterrence from engaging in any athletic activity at all. This is the attitude of those who say “lifting heavy weights i”</p>
