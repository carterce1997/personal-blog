I"X<p>Aching branches fracture the sky in vain,
Displaying empty beauty and strength.
They utter silent, futile whimpers.</p>

<p>Mankind is like the trees.
As he sojourns an empty frame all his days, homesick,
His ache is not soothed even in death.</p>

<p>Where is man’s home?
The whole world groans:
“Not here, and not there either”.</p>
