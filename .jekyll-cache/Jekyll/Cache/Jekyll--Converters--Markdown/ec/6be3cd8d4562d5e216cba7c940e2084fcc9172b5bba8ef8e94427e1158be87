I"E<p>As I walk <br />
I watch the stars worship You <br />
And I hear the stones sing Your praises. <br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>But my eyes are glass <br />
Destitution is my air <br />
And sorrow aches in my bones. <br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I sing empty words. <br />
And I long to see You <br />
As You are. <br /></p>
