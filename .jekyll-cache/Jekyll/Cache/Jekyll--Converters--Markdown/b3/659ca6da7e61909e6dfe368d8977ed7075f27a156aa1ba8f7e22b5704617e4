I"Â<p>For the last eight years, I have walked with Christ.</p>

<p>Eight years ago I heard the gospel preached in an early morning bible study held by a handful of students in a small conference room at my high school. All at once, the yearning I had to know God and to be right with Him was satisfied; I knew at once that Christ had died for my sins, and that He was raised from the dead so I could live with Him forever. I knew that no matter what happened for the rest of my life, I would be justified before Him.</p>

<p>Walking with God for one year, eight years, or fifty years is not a testimony of individual will or dedication. Far from it. Sin, temptation, loneliness, and bad influences were all things that should have drawn me away from God. What I see in retrospect is not my ability to overcome these things, but my inability; it was the hand of God at every moment renewing my mind, directing me, and guiding my decisions that kept me with Him.</p>
