<p><br /></p>

<p>It is well known among mathematicians and non-mathematicians that mathematics is a tool which permits the knowledge of imperceptible truths. By the use of our reason, we conceive that the world around us is ordered, that there is a consistent way which things function apart from our mere perception of them. We take the reality of cause and effect, of quantity, of distance, of space, etc. as things which are fundamental and objective realities external to our minds. Not only do we use our knowledge of how the world works to infer how it will work in the future, but knowledge of this world allows our reason to suppose and reason about other kinds of worlds. Mathematics and narrative are not so different in this respect. ‚ÄúGive me a world‚Äù, they say, ‚Äúand I will show you what it is like. Perhaps, in doing so, you can learn more about the world you are in.‚Äù</p>

<p>Thus like a great narrator, a great mathematician draws their insight and their inspiration from the world around them. Euclid did not begin to think about geometry purely as a consequence of his reason; he was inspired to explain geometry in order to understand the geometry that he already saw in the world, and perhaps to conceive of geometries which he hadn‚Äôt already observed. So it goes not only with geometry, but with any other field of mathematics. Topology was invented by Leonard Euler as he studied parade routes along the Seven Bridges of Konigsburg, though the discipline is now used to study the spatial connectedness of almost unimaginably complex objects in very strange types of spaces. Calculus was invented by Isaac Newton to understand and canonize a theory of physical motion, though it has grown into a field which studies the concepts of ‚Äúrate‚Äù and ‚Äúchange‚Äù in as general a sense as is desired.</p>

<p>As a trained mathematician myself, I understand the predictive and explanatory power of mathematics. A skilled mathematician can use equation, inference, and deduction to learn imperceptible knowledge, and I often engaged in projects and research studies where mathematics was being used to explain or predict some very profound things.</p>

<p>Mathematics allows us to know truths which cannot be perceived, and to perceive the existence of truths which can never be known.‚Äù</p>

<p>Thus, we must infer that some truths, some beauties, and some wonders, are unknowable and always will be unknowable to us. These things exist solely for God Himself to enjoy. The unknowable lays siege to the small village of dim luminance inhabited by mankind, as a vastness of impenetrably dark wilderness expanding infinitely far and infinitely densely in every direction we could vainly turn our telescope. Even our daily lives do not escape entanglement in threads of mystery, like long tentacles of imperceptible truth which slip through the brick and mortar of the tightest theorems we can muster to protect our dimly lit epistemology. At every side, mankind is haunted by dreadful uncertainty as he sojourns world in darkness, the fire of his muddled reason illuminating not quite enough of his way to keep him from stumbling in error.</p>
