I"¯<p><em>‚ÄúBut deep in the darkness is God‚Ä¶‚Äù ~ Rilke</em></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>We often assume that all things are knowable.</p>

<p>One of the curious properties of mathematics is its incompleteness. Mathematics is incomplete, not because we have not proved everything, but because we <em>cannot</em> prove everything.</p>

<p>Mathematics allows us to know truths which cannot be perceived, and to perceive the existence of truths which can never be known.</p>

<p>Thus, we must infer that some truths, some beauties, and some wonders, are unknowable and always will be unknowable to us. These things exist solely for God Himself to enjoy. The Unknowable lays siege to the small village of dim luminance inhabited by mankind, as a vastness of impenetrably dark wilderness expanding infinitely far and infinitely densely in every direction. Mankind cannot peer into the darkness outside the gates and determine what is merely Unknown, and what is Unknowable. Those who seek to know must confront the darkest parts of the boundary between the known and the unknown, as if to walk into the darkest part of the forest hoping to cut through the impenetrable dark with the dim torch of our own reason. Even our daily lives do not escape entanglement in threads of mystery, like long tentacles of imperceptible truth which slip through the brick and mortar of the tightest theorems we can muster to protect our dimly lit epistemology. At every side, mankind is haunted by the vast and dreadful Unknowable.</p>

<p>To God, the whole show is as plain as day. Every unknowable mystery which wounds the curiosity men is not just elementary to God, it is axiomatic. Its full understanding, beauty, and glory are known fully to Him, and were created by Him alone for Him alone to enjoy.</p>
