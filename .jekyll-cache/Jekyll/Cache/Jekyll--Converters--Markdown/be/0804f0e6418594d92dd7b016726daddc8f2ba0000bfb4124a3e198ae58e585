I"Ÿ<p>One of the peculiar facts about Man is that he considers himself to be a distinct entity from the Natural World that he inhabits. To Man, the Universe is a vast thing to explore, manipulate, utilize, and learn from. Such tasks are accomplished, as has been discussed previously, by the Observation of Natural Order and the inference of the Laws of Nature via the faculty of Reason. Manâ€™s ability to set himself apart from the workings of the Universe, at least in his mind, allows himself to consider the meaning of such Observations in a nearly unbiased fashion. It is important to clarify what is meant here. Manâ€™s ability to divorce Man from Observation is unbiased in that he is able to remove himself as an agent of mechanism in whatever phenomenon he observes, save perhaps, the case when he is acting as the causal initiator of an experiment. He has no bearing on the mechanism of The Law of Gravitation acting on an apple; he is not physical reason why the apple falls, he merely releases the apple to fall according to the Law which is external to himself.</p>

<p>Given these facts, it is even more peculiar how the tendency of Man is to regard <em>himself</em></p>
