I"†<p>True worship values and treasures God above all things, in spirit and in truth, as infinitely great, infinitely loving, infinitely powerful, infinitely knowing. Worship is the most important activity that we can engage in as humans. It does not enhance life, it is how we ought to aspire to live at every moment. All of our activities, from our work, to our relationships, to our endeavors, to our thoughts, ought to be framed in the soul by the context of God‚Äôs majesty. That is precisely <em>why</em> Christians have ‚ÄúChristian Values‚Äù. ‚ÄúHonor my Father‚Äù, Christ says, and we who are in Christ aspire to do so, if only faintly, for we love the Father, and the Father loves us. We love the Law of God, not because by loving it it saves us, but because we are saved by the Lawgiver, and we love Him for His greatness, and by connection we love His instruction to us. All of life, for the Christian, is worship.</p>
