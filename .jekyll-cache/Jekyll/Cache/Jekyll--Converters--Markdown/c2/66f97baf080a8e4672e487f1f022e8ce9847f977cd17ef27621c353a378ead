I"À<p>Christians who try to justify voting for the Democratic party often cite a dilemma like this:</p>

<p>â€œPro-life people only want to prevent abortions, but donâ€™t want to guarantee healthcare for all.â€</p>

<p>And, thatâ€™s almost invariably true with a plain reading. What is <em>implied</em> is that there exists a kind of hypocrisy that exists among pro-life people that causes them only to care about unborn life, and not born life.</p>
