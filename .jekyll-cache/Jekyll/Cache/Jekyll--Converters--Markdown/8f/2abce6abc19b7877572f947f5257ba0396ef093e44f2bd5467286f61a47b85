I"P<p>In times of calamity I find myself pondering not how things have gone so horribly wrong, but how things seemed to remain stable for the great duration of serenity leading up to the present moment. My instincts as a scientist (but not an epidemiologist) tell me that outbreaks of infectious disease on this scale ought to be more common. Perhaps that’s an argument as to how good our pandemic deterrence systems really are, or perhaps it’s a comment better served to a skeptic of the drastic political reaction to this disease. The widespread social and economic consequences of the event are unprecedented, but only in our lifetimes. Human history is a sequential enumeration of calamities, oppressions, disasters, revolutions, and the like. If it’s not a virus, then it is political tension, or threat of terrorism, or business cycles, or natural catastrophes. The world is not, as many Rousseauians would like to believe, a harmonious paradise whose calamities are the result of human activity alone, nor are humans “noble savages” who have only society to blame for their deep corruption. Catastrophe is always imminent at every level of existence, and at the limits of human ingenuity to keep it at bay and simple dumb luck to avoid it, we experience the invocation of Stein’s Law: “if something cannot go on forever, it will stop”.</p>
