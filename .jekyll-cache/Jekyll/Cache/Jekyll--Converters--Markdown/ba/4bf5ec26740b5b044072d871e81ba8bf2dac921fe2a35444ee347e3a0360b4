I"Î<p>Federal and state health officials claim there exists a causal relationship between taking distancing measures, like economic shutdown, and the mitigation of the spread of infectious disease. They wonâ€™t use the words â€œcausal relationshipâ€ outright, but their adamancy that officials force the adoption of these distancing policies is indicative that they believe very strongly that â€œif we do social distancing, then COVID-19 will be mitigatedâ€.</p>
