I"›<p>As we press on towards the fulfillment of the great commission, we must remember that our actions and our duties in this life are acts of war. Following Christ was a vote of political allegiance that each of us made upon our conversion, to obey the authority of King Jesus alone, at all cost. The Romans understood the early Church this way; ‚ÄúJesus is Lord‚Äù is a political statement, after all, because someone who is wholly devoted to God cannot ever be wholly devoted to a leader of this world. We render to Caesar what is Caesar‚Äôs, and no more; Caesar can keep our income taxes, but we belong to God. Our mission in this world is one of insurrection: to do away with the systems of the world through the faithful and peaceful preaching of the Gospel. The way we wage war is not by working from the top down through political might, but bottom up, as the Gospel is worked through the whole world like yeast through a lump of dough. Spiritual war is won, one soul at a time.</p>
