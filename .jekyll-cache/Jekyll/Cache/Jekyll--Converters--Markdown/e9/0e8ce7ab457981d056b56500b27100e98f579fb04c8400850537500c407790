I"µ<p>Aching branches fracture the sky in vain, <br />
Displaying empty beauty and strength. <br />
They utter silent, futile whimpers. <br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Mankind is like the trees. <br />
As he sojourns an empty frame all his days, homesick, <br />
His ache is not soothed even in death. <br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Where is manâ€™s home? <br />
The whole world groans: <br />
â€œNot here, and not there eitherâ€. <br /></p>
