I"³<p>Itâ€™s hard to introduce a topic like this, not because itâ€™s so specific, but because itâ€™s so general. Calamity is one of those things that needs no introduction. The history of the human race is, to a great extent, the enumeration of calamities in their chronological sequence, in the form of a list of wars, plagues, uprisings, and travesties. Times of peace and comfort are a rarity, and thatâ€™s just a reality of life.</p>
