<p><em>“But deep in the darkness is God…” ~ Rilke</em></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>It is well known among mathematicians and non-mathematicians that mathematics is a tool which permits the knowledge of imperceptible truths. Mankind gazes upon the world and, by reason, conceives that it is ordered, that there is a consistent way which things function apart from the mere perception of them. The observation of cause-and-effect, of quantity, of distance, of angle, measure, structure, form, rule, and connectedness provide a framework within which people can order their own reason. We take these things to be fundamental and objective realities external to our minds, and further, we use these realities to make subjunctive conclusions about this world and other possible worlds. It was not Euclid’s reason alone which allowed him to suppose of a mathematical notion of geometry, nor Euler’s reason alone which enlightened him to the notion of topology, rather, their reason was sparked to “creative supposition” about these things from the observation of the world around them. Mathematics is an intensely pragmatic science, contrary to the dissent of many professors and researchers who seek to divorce mathematics from its physical inspirations for the sake of “purity”. The push to make mathematics an ethereal science with no basis other than axiom and reason alone is a departure from the how the subject was conceived of in the minds of the great mathematicians of the past, who saw mathematics as an instrument to understand the world as it was, and as it could be.</p>

<p>Mathematics allows us to know truths which cannot be perceived, and to perceive the existence of truths which can never be known.”</p>

<p>Thus, we must infer that some truths, some beauties, and some wonders, are unknowable and always will be unknowable to us. These things exist solely for God Himself to enjoy. The unknowable lays siege to the small village of dim luminance inhabited by mankind, as a vastness of impenetrably dark wilderness expanding infinitely far and infinitely densely in every direction we could vainly turn our telescope. Even our daily lives do not escape entanglement in threads of mystery, like long tentacles of imperceptible truth which slip through the brick and mortar of the tightest theorems we can muster to protect our dimly lit epistemology. At every side, mankind is haunted by dreadful uncertainty as he sojourns world in darkness, the fire of his muddled reason illuminating not quite enough of his way to keep him from stumbling in error.</p>
