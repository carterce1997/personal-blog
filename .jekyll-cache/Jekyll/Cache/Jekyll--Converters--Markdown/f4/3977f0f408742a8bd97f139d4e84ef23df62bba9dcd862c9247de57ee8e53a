I"I<p>One of the peculiar facts about Man is that he considers himself to be a distinct entity from the Natural World which he inhabits. In his own eyes, Man is the Great Explorer of the Universe; he cannot tear his gaze away from its beauty and possibility, nor does he desire to make his hands rest from productivity and creativity. To cease exploration and work would be to cease a great deal of human activity. This is how the ancient Hebrews conceptualized death: in Sheol, there is no activity, no work, no progress, no way to praise God.</p>

<p>We have discussed previously how man accomplishes his great Exploration using his faculties of Observation and Reason, from which he is able to discern the existence of the Laws of Nature. Man’s ability to set himself apart from the workings of the Universe, at least in his mind, allows himself to consider the meaning of such Observations with respect to the Laws of Nature. He is able to remove himself as an agent of “mechanism” from whatever phenomenon he observes, except in the case when he is acting as the causal initiator of an experiment. Neither his mind nor his being have any bearing on the mechanism of The Law of Gravitation, for example; the Law is something distinct from him, which he himself is distinct from.</p>

<p>This ability, the ability to create an abstraction of a phenomenon, is a great philosophical advancement that has allowed him to make monumental leaps and bounds in all disciplines of thought. However, ambiguity is confronted when he turns the microscope on himself. The more that Man sees himself as a sovereign individual observer of the Created Order, and not as part of that Created Order himself, the greater his tendency will be to believe that no Law exists which governs the way which he ought to be. Perhaps he thinks he is too complex to have a Law, or perhaps he thinks that he needs to make his own Law. In either case, when Man regards himself as a separate entity from the Created Order, he ceases to believe that he is under Lawful governance.</p>

<p>We know from Observation and Reason that all things within Nature have a Law, and that they have a Law because God transacted a Law to them. The World acts in ways that can be comprehended by Reason, and therefore we infer that God created the World by means of Reason. There is no evidence that Man would be any different than any other created thing. Man is an aspect of Creation, and therefore his being and his actions are governed by Law, from his most rudimentary physiological processes to the highest workings of his conscious mind. It might surprise the reader to hear that the mind of man which is typically assumed to be Free is also governed by Law; how can a free thing be constrained to act in a certain way? We reconcile this tension by saying that acting in accordance with a Law is to act in accordance with what is prescribed to be harmonious with its natural function. To say that an apple is <em>governed</em> by the Law of Gravitation means that it <em>ought</em> to fall to the Earth when it is dropped, is analogous to saying that the Law of Man <em>governs</em> the Free and Reasoning mind of man by prescribing the way that it <em>ought</em> to behave. In the same way, the mind of Man is governed by the Law of Man, in that it <em>should not</em> will to commit murder, or to indulge itself in pornography, or to commit other deviant ad destructive acts. The Law of Man governs the mind to instead be peaceful, forgiving, chaste, diligent, and righteous.</p>

<p>The Law of Man, also known as Moral Law, or simply as Morality, is thus not a complete constraint on the mind of man that guides its every action. Within the scope of the Law, there is freedom to act in a multitude of ways. While the human race has devised a great number of violent and clever ways to commit murder, there are a great deal more ways to abstain from murder entirely. It is not as if the Moral Law, in governing the mind, “Thou shalt not murder,” constrains a Lawful being to only one path forward in any situation, and certainly the constraint is not so severe as to abdicate Reason. Lawful minds should not turn off their ability to think or to decide; to the contrary, they exercise great care in their thinking and decision making!</p>

<p>Yet even the freedom given to act, create, and live within the parameters of the Moral Law is too little for the mind of man to be content with. He is a great peculiarity in the Universe, exercising his will to transgress the Moral Law and failing to behave as he ought to. Man relegates his mind to violent acts of murder, slander, selfishness, and depraved fantasy. He willingly submits his body to all kinds of addiction, sexual deviance, violence, and uselessness. His transgression against the Law of Man reaches down to the very core of his being: no fiber of his body and no stirring of his consciousness can escape the slavery of Lawlessness that he has subjected himself to. Thus Man is orients himself towards disharmony with himself and with others.</p>

<p>Some may reject this narrative in favor of affirming a different explanation of the nature of man. They may cite the transgressions listed above as the natural behavior of human beings, arguing from observations about the passions, desires, and lusts that are observed in the behavior of mankind. They would argue that, “the way that man acts is just the way that he ought to act; he was designed to be selfish, violent, and deviant”.</p>

<!-- There are a few problems with this view, the first being the issue of conscience. Man, the great Observer, is also able to Observe the inner workings of his own mind, especially when it cries out in offense at the moral violations it incurs. Very few men are so wicked as to have their conscience completely desensitized to immorality; even hardened criminals take moral stances against harm being brought against children, for example. As long as the conscience remains intact, it remains an Observable indicator of moral transgression. When a person says, "I don't feel right about doing this", they are speaking on behalf of conscience, and not a mere social platitude. It is much easier to forget to say "please and thank you" than it is to ignore the weight of a guilty conscience. -->

<!-- There is a deeper and more foundational reason that selfishness, violence, and deviance cannot be the natural and harmonious modality of man's behavior: no one would deny that murder, or rape, or sexual deviance, or pride, or envy promote anything harmonious in the life of anyone. Nature is ordered. It works in harmony, with each component acting according to the Laws of Nature, to the end that its action compliments the actions of other components, who act according to their own Laws. A transgression of the Moral Law, as I have described it, is a transgression against another person; it is the infliction of pain and brokenness on another human being. Reason does not permit us to conclude that pain and brokenness are evidence that things are the way they ought to be. Universally, it would be better if unnecessary physical and psychological pain did not exist. By our actions, we perpetrate the existence of things which we conclude ought not to exist, and it follows that we must act in some other way. Deny this conclusion, and you deny any moral comfort in the midst of pain and brokenness. You should not feel any duty to comfort the widow, nor give to the poor, nor to stand for justice, and if you do any of these things you not say that you do them for any moral reason. -->

<p>Reason forbids us from abandoning the Moral Law.</p>

<p>More importantly, we know</p>

<p>Thus, Man has a Law and is a transgressor of that Law. This is exactly what is meant when the Bible says that all men have sinned, and have fallen short. Sin is a “missing of the mark”; a failure to live in harmony with ourselves, with others, and with the God who created all things.</p>
