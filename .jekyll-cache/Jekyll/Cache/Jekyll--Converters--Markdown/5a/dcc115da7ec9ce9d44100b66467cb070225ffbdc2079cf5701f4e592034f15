I"c<p>Christians who try to justify voting for the Democratic party often cite a dilemma like this:</p>

<p>“Pro-life people only want to prevent abortions, but don’t want to guarantee healthcare for all.”</p>

<p>And, that’s almost invariably true with a plain reading; the kind that only a logician could pull off. What is <em>implied</em> is that there exists a kind of hypocrisy that exists among pro-life people that causes them only to care about unborn life, and not innate life (“born life” is a funny term…hence the avoidance).</p>

<p>It’s vexing to me that I have to explain the fallacy here. The crux of it is this:</p>

<p><em>Life is a right. Healthcare and other human flourishing benefits are not rights.</em></p>

<p>Unborn babies are human beings. Human beings are made in the image of God. Abortion is the termination of the life of an unborn baby; it is the murder of a human life. The murder of human beings is outright prohibited in God’s Law, without exception.</p>

<p><em>You shall not murder.</em> (Exodus 20:13)</p>

<p>Any political party which advocates for murder of any kind is an evil party who seeks to propagate evil, whether it is the Nazi Party, the Bolshevik Party, <em>or the Democratic Party</em>. Period.</p>

<p>Healthcare, by contrast, is not a human right. Healthcare is the product of human labor, namely the labor of doctors, nurses, surgeons, physical therapists, and other healthcare practitioners. You do not have a right to someone else’s labor. If you force their labor, you are stealing from them, and if you fund their labor through taxation, you are stealing from the taxpayer. Stealing is outright prohibited in God’s Law, without exception (even for governments).</p>

<p><em>You shall not steal.</em> (Exodus 20:15)</p>

<p>If you don’t steal it, but you harbor resent and desire in your heart for the things that others have, you are committing the sin of covetousness. Covetousness is outright prohibited in God’s Law, without exception.</p>

<p><em>You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his donkey or anything else that belongs to your neighbor.</em> (Exodus 20:17)</p>

<p>Healthcare is a tremendous blessing that we enjoy, and we should absolutely facilitate the free market dynamics that make healthcare education and practice available to the most people for the best price. However, to say that healthcare should be offered for no price at all to any willing buyer is as arbitrary as saying that auto mechanics should fix cars for free, or farmers should provide food for free. Lots of people are starving in the world, so why are Democrats only “holistically-pro-life” when it comes to healthcare? Why not similar policies for the food supply? Or for automobile repair?</p>

<p>Christians who advocate against abortion and who don’t advocate for universal free healthcare are merely following God’s Law. Democrats, who dissent from the opinions of Christians, don’t support abortion and free healthcare because they actually love people; they just love their sin.</p>
