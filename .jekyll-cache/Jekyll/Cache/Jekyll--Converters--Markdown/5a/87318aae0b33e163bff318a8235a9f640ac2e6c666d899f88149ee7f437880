I"»<p>I love Blaise Pascalâ€™s <em>Pensees</em>. Itâ€™s a collection of theological and philosophical meditations with the kind of succinctness, curtness, bite, and obduration to them thatâ€™s wholly missing in most philosophy and almost all contemporary evangelicalism. Pascal  was a mathematician, a physicist, an inventor, and a theologian. He writes like all of those things. Mathematicians and physicists have a particular way of speaking that is simultaneously very succinct and very thorough. I, personally, find many philosophers and theologians to be too wordy; Pascal is a breath of fresh air. Consider this:</p>

<p><em>Vanity.</em> The cause and effect of love. Cleopatra. (<em>Pensees 46</em>)</p>

<p>In one fragment, he has discussed an entire claim and provided a proof of it with a single word. Lovely!</p>

<p>Men should understand poetry as a tool of rhetoric. It has a place in the persuasion of the masses and the wooing of a woman.</p>
