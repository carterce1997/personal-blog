I"Ë<p>As an athlete (or at least a hobbyist athlete), I can confirm that being physically injured to the extent that you can‚Äôt train sucks. It‚Äôs an inevitable reality of pushing yourself in any physical domain that you will <em>eventually</em> get injured somehow. If you don‚Äôt get hurt every once in a while, chances are you‚Äôre missing out on a lot of performance. To some, the prospect of getting injured is a strong deterrence from engaging in any athletic activity at all. On the extreme end of the spectrum are those who say ‚Äúwith all of the wear and tear that exercise puts on the body, it‚Äôs not worth it to do any sort of hard training‚Äù.</p>

<p>Let us consider the end state of a human being. Every human being who has ever existed has died of trauma; trauma, in the technical sense that something or another ‚Äúoverwhelms‚Äù our bodies and causes them to cease to function. Dying in a car accident produces a different kind of trauma than dying of cancer or dying of old age (which is a state in which life itself is too much for an infrailed body to bear). At some point or another, every human being will experience bodily dysfunction, either as a function of trauma or disease, or as a slow decay into inability. Physical pain is an unavoidable part of the human experience, whether you train hard or not. Those who believe that they will be able to ride out their life injury-free by not performing any physical activity are sadly mistaken. They are deluded into believing that they are in control of all of the variables in their life, and grossly underestimate the need for the positive benefits of hard physical training in everyday life. Calamity, crisis, danger, or the need for competence may manifest from the unknown at any moment.</p>
