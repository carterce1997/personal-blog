I"w<p>There are two ways that dichotomies can be false. There may be additional options, or there may only be one option. A dichotomy supposes that everything is something and not something else. Sometimes this is right, and sometimes it’s wrong. When it’s wrong, there are either too many options or too few, and this is where people disagree. Those who want to add options assert the existence of a possibilities which haven’t been accounted for. Those who want to take away options say that everything just “is”, with no need for distinctions, unless of course you consider the things which are not “is” as well.</p>
