I"X<p>Unapologetics: a play on the word <em>unapologetic</em>, meaning put forth as such without qualification, and the word <em>apologetics</em>, based on the Greek <em>apologia</em>, meaning a systematic argumentative discourse in defense of an idea. That idea is the maxim that Christ is supreme, in all things, times, and places.</p>

<p>The idea is not to come at this idea by means of syllogism, as is fashionable among contemporary Christian apologists, but to defend the faith by means of illustration, narrative, exposition of special revelation, and the exploration of the physical world.</p>
