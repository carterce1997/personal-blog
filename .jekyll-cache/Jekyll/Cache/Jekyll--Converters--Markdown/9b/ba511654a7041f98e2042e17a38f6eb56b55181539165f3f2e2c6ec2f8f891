I"Ô<p>Christians who try to justify voting for the Democratic party often cite a dilemma like this:</p>

<p>â€œPro-life people only want to prevent abortions, but donâ€™t want to guarantee healthcare for all.â€</p>

<p>And, thatâ€™s almost invariably true with a plain reading. What is <em>implied</em> is that there exists a kind of hypocrisy that exists among pro-life people that causes them only to care about unborn life, and not innate life (â€œborn lifeâ€ is a funny termâ€¦hence the avoidance).</p>

<p>Itâ€™s vexing to me that I have to explain the fallacy here.</p>

<p>Life is a right. Healthcare and other human flourishing endeavors are not rights.</p>

<p>Unborn babies are human beings. Human beings are made in the image of God. Abortion is the termination of the life of an unborn baby; it is the murder of a human life. The murder of human beings is outright prohibited in Godâ€™s Law, without exception.</p>

<p><em>You shall not murder.</em> (Exodus 20:13)</p>
