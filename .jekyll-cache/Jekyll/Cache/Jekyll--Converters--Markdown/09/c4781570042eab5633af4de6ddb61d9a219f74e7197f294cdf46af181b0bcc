I"8<p>I watch the stars worship You <br />
And I hear the stones sing Your praises. <br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>But my eyes are glass <br />
Destitution is my air <br />
And sorrow brings ache to my bones. <br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>My song is empty. <br />
For I long to see You <br />
As You are. <br /></p>
