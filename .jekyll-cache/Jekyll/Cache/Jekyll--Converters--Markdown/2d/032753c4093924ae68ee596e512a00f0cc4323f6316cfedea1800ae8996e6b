I"ÿ<p>Andrew Cuomo recently stated to the Orthodox Jewish community, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not going to live with these [COVID-19] rules, then I‚Äôm going to close the synagogues‚Äù. Now, to be fair to the Governor, he did seem to express some remorse over this action, citing the long history he has had with the Orthodox Jewish community and the risk of jeopardizing that relationship over the policies he sees necessary. I stumbled on a tweet by The Hill which documents it.</p>
