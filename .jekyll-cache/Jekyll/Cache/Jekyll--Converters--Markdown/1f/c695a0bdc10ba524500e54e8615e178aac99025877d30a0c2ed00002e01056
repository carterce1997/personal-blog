I"<p>Chivalry is colloquially understood by modern people as a set of actions which constitute “good manners” especially with respect to interactions between men and women. A chivalrous man, in the modern conception of the term, holds the door for a woman, minds his language around her, and might offer her his jacket if she gets cold. It’s a bit beyond “good manners”: instead of a set of behaviors based upon giving honor and respect to everyone around you, no matter the circumstance, chivalry is a consequence of the natural differences between men and women. The chivalrous man honors a woman for who she is, and as such, he takes into account her strengths, weaknesses, and desires to be treated differently than he would treat his male counterparts when he interacts with her.</p>
