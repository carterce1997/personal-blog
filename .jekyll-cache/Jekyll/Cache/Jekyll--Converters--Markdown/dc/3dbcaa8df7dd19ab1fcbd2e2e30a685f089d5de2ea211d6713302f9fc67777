I"<p>The COVID-19 government fiasco marked a critical turning point in the collective consciousness of the population of the United States and its relationship to the power and authority of government. We were once autonomous revolutionaries, who dreamed of the freedom to make our own way in life. Now we are merely a populace, whose majority will gladly give up its dreams and freedoms for safeties and legislation. Furthermore, few share the ethic which is presented in the Biblical text, which enumerates the value of life, the dignity of man, the glory and sacredness of sexuality, the appropriate expression of it in heterosexual marriage, the importance of the family unit as the building block of society, and the overarching moral law of love and servitude for fellow man.</p>
