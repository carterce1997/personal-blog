<p>In general, I think it’s a good idea to have a mostly optimistic demeanor. We are awarded the justification for this attitude in Christ. He rules over all and He has restored the whole world to Himself by His death and resurrection, thus precluding any justification for pessimism even under a staunchly pessimistic eschatology. Christ has already won, amen and amen.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Because of this it is important for us to remain on the alert to serve Him and to advance His kingdom on the planet. We are to remain as wise as serpents and as innocent as doves, in that we trust innocently that Christ’s power and work are sufficient to fulfill all of His promises to us, and in that we approach the imposing armies of worldliness as skilled warriors armed with weapons of truth, righteousness, and salvation. There is a battle afoot; and strategies must be drawn, vigil must be kept, and maneuvers must be performed.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>With that being said, there seem to be a couple of facts about the fiasco surrounding COVID-19 that would raise some red flags for a guy who was looking for them. I think Alex Jones and I could probably enjoy a beer together if we needed to, and I’ve had some practice metaphorically sitting in a foxhole taking shells, so let’s be cynical for a moment. I don’t doubt that there’s a real virus that really acts the way that it has been reported to act. I don’t doubt that it is as contagious as it has been reported to be. I don’t doubt that it poses some level of danger to society, and I think it’s wise to be cautious about how we interact in the world. That being said…</p>

<p>Would it be convenient for there to be a major socioeconomic event that could be used as political leverage during an election year?</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Would it be convenient if something required a whole lot of government intervention in order to make Trump look good, or Cuomo look good, or the Dems look bad, or Trump look bad?</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Would it be convenient for common Americans to have to be put in a situation where they were required to collect a government “stimulus” check for a long period of time amid rising political interest in democratic socialism?</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Would it be convenient for there to be preexisting legal precedent to undermine foundational Constitutional rights (such as the First and Second Amendments) in the presence of great perceived societal danger?</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Would it be convenient to go to war with China?</p>
