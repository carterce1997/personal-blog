I"L<p>Loneliness has always been my great affliction. Throughout my life I have often felt rejected, overlooked, or outcast, enjoyed by friends and people when I am around, but forgotten in my absence. Being alone in and of itself carries with it some inherent discomfort, but for me, the greater pain comes from the hermeneutics of what being alone means, or rather how I interpret being alone. How I perceive the situation is a far more debilitating toxin to my soul than what being alone merely is. Being alone is the simple experience of solitude, but to me, and because of my life experiences, I have a habit of concluding that I am alone because I am rejected. Solitude is a vacuum where my fears and insecurities have room to become strengthened and rise up to devour me; a vacancy of acceptance which must be resolved by explanation, whose only explanation must be some failure of mine, or some unacceptable inadequacy in my character. Loneliness, to me, is not merely discomfort during peace and quiet, it is a deafening torment of self-criticism and deep longing to be loved and accepted.</p>
