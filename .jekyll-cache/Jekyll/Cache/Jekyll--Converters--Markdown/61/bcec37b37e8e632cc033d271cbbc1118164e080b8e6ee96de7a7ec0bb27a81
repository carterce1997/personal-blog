I"á<p>Tonightâ€™s presidential debate was, well, hardly a discussion of ideas or a battle of intellectual wills between two men. My dad put it best when he said, â€œTrump lost, but Biden didnâ€™t beat himâ€. I couldnâ€™t have said it better. I really wasnâ€™t expecting anything grand or impressive from Biden. He performed about as I thought he would: he stuck to the middle, tried his best to avoid the more abrasive Democratic talking points, and generally followed the rules of debate, but mostly bumbled his way through trying to appeal to the median voter. All Trump really had to do was shut up and keep sharp enough to answer the questions. When heâ€™s not being belligerent, he answers them better, and he has better answers.</p>
