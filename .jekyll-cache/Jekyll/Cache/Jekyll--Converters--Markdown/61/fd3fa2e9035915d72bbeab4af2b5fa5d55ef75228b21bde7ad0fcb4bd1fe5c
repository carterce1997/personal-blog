I"≈<p>Ironically, it is in the book of Jonah where we get a glimpse, among other things, of what widespread repentance actually looks like. In the story, Jonah was tasked by God to deliver a warning of God‚Äôs judgement, and subsequent impending calamity, against the wicked city of Ninevah. After being vomited up on the beach from the belly of a whale, and reluctantly delivering his brief message concerning this judgement, Jonah witnessed the entire city of wicked men and women cry out to God and don themselves with sackcloth and ashes in brokenhearted repentance.</p>

<p>Faith requires repentance, a turning from evil, a restoration and recalibration of a broken moral compass; alignment of action, conscience, and God‚Äôs Law. We repent, as Christians, since it has been illumined to us by the Holy Spirit that our actions, as they are, stand contrary to the Law of the One we love and fear. You cannot be a Christian and refuse to repent, nor is the truth of Christ in you if you say that you are without sin. It is by grace that we are reminded of our wretched state before our God whenever consequences of sin beset us with suffering, as if God was saying to the world, ‚ÄúWake up, and turn from sin, lest something worse befall you!‚Äù It is a common and effective rebuke.</p>

<p>I often hear that my nation, the United States, is a Christian nation. ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù I say, in genuine surprise at the absurdity of the proposition which has crossed into the theater of my mind. Which parts of this nation, exactly, are the Christian parts? Is it our sexual promiscuity? Our fondness of drink and drug? Our overt and shameless celebration of homosexuality and transgenderism? Is it the fact that we murder 1 in 5 of our unborn babies, each of whome is made in the image of God? Or is it the fact that half of our marriages end in divorce? Or, perhaps, is it the crippling debt slavery which enraptures our young people through the Biblically prohibited practice of usury? Or, maybe, is it the rapid export of the false gospel known as ‚Äúhealth, wealth, and prosperity‚Äù from the pulpits of false teachers littered across our land and piped through our TV screens? Or is it the false worldview of moralistic therapeutic deism, held by many professing ‚ÄúChristians‚Äù who believe that God will reward them with Heaven for their good works? It must be, then, our cowardice to stand against these things, or else our ignorance of what God‚Äôs word really says, no?</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I ask again: which parts of this nation, exactly, are the Christian parts?</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>If the United States were a Christian nation, we would have been compelled to our knees in repentance for our vile and Godless deeds at the first report of the impending pandemic. Indeed, we would have long since done so. Lord knows our actions have warranted us a punishment far worse than COVID-19; such wrath is being stored up for the Day of Judgment. Instead of revering and fearing God, we chose to serve ourselves, and we abandoned hope that God would be gracious to repentant souls, and subsequently our leadership declared the weekly gathering of believers to worship the Almighty Creator of the Universe to be a ‚Äúnon essential‚Äù service, and further, boldly proclaimed in our pride that ‚ÄúGod did not do that‚Äù as the disease showed signs of slowing its spread. Even as states are ‚Äúallowing‚Äù believers to return to worship, singing praises to God is still a prohibited activity. Worse still, many churches were okay with shutting their doors for the purpose of mitigating the spread of the disease. That is how little we hope in God: we would sooner trade the riches of repentance, and the greatness and joy of right relationship with the Lord through Christ, for panicked survival tactics.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>In the book of Hebrews, chapter 10, believers are admonished to not forsake gathering together to edify and encourage one another in the worship of God, not as a matter of ‚ÄúChristian living‚Äù, but as a logical consequence of the greatness of God in Christ. Gathering together to lift our voices in prayer, in preaching, and in praise is the primary means by which we testify to ourselves, and to others, and to the world, the unfathomable greatness of God in Christ. We do this, in keeping with the tradition set forth by our Lord Himself, who gathered with His followers to break bread, fellowship, weep, pray, and join together in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. By these things, we proclaim that God is able to save us from our sin, and from every calamity which could befall us.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Repent, my nation, and repent, my brothers and sisters; gather together to weep, and to turn to God in sackcloth, ashes, and praise.</p>
