I"<p>I suspected months ago that Cuomo would extend the shutdown in New York State for at least another two weeks when we reached the May 15 deadline, regardless of the new evidence we have surrounding the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. I’m sad to say that I was right, and my prediction is that in the short-term we will have to be dealing with social distancing for months or years, and long-term life as we know it won’t return to a state of normalcy for another couple of years or decades.</p>
