I"Å<p>Critical Race Theory is a fundamentally different view of justice than the one the Bible teaches. Aristotle‚Äôs definition of justice is ‚Äúrendering to those that which they are due‚Äù. The question only remains, ‚Äúwho is due what?‚Äù Scripture makes this very clear in Deuteronomy 24:16 when it says</p>

<p><em>Parents are not to be put to death for their children, nor children put to death for their parents; each will die for their own sin.</em></p>

<p>The ‚Äúwho‚Äù in Biblical justice is the individual, and what they are ‚Äúdue‚Äù is calculated according to their sin; the wages of sin (what we are ‚Äúdue‚Äù) is death, so each of us (individuals, the ‚Äúwho‚Äù) ought to die for our own sin. Fathers will not die for the sins of their sons, nor will sons die for the sins of their fathers, but each will be rendered what he is due individually according to his own sins.</p>

<p>CRT answers these differently. The ‚Äúwho‚Äù in CRT is not the individual, but an intersection of categories; not any person in particular, but a particular intersectional swath of the human race. What they are ‚Äúdue‚Äù is all that they perceive they are missing out on by not being a member of the ‚Äúdominating‚Äù intersectional class; normally the straight, white, Christian male take this role. This notion of justice doesn‚Äôt account for the sins of the individual. Individual sin and justice brought to individuals are moot points under CRT. <em>Under Critical Race Theory, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre an upstanding straight, white, Christian male, because you‚Äôre a part of the oppressing class. Under Critical Race Theory, your good individual character means nothing, and it would be an efficient service of justice for you to be treated like the harshest of your slave-owning ancestors because of your sexual orientation, your religious convictions, and (most importantly) the color of your skin.</em></p>

<p>Critical Race Theory <em>is</em> judicial partiality. Whether you are white or black, male or female, or rich or poor <em>matters</em> in how your sin is counted against you. Contrast this with God‚Äôs perfect judicial accounting of individual punishment for individual sin, which renders to each what he is due <em>regardless</em> of race, nationality, gender, or socioeconomic status. Critical Race Theory, in this way, condemns sons for the sins of their fathers, and fathers for the sins of their sons, based on their particular and uncontrollable association to people groups which are either deemed ‚Äúoppressed‚Äù or ‚Äúoppressors‚Äù. There is no way to describe how patently unjust and unbiblical this concept is, <em>and yet</em> CRT has already made the leap from academia, to the street, to the pulpit. This is thanks, in large part, to evangelical leaders who lost their balls a long time ago. Men I used to look up to, like Tim Keller, Matt Chandler, and even Al Mohler, have all either recently twisted Scripture to accommodate CRT in their teaching, or have enabled it at the institutions they govern (looking at you, Gospel Coalition and Southern Seminary). ‚ÄúWoke churches‚Äù have made CRT a staple of their Sunday preaching and their ecclesiological ethos, teaching an intersectional view of justice <em>alongside the word of God from the pulpit</em> and ‚Äúseeking to promote and foster conversations around race and injustice‚Äù.</p>

<p>I guarantee there is a church in your city that does this. Maybe your town.</p>

<p>Why is this important? For one, the Biblical notion of individual punishment for individual sin is the foundation of Liberalism, a.k.a., the principles the West was founded upon. But even more importantly, once we remove the notion of individual punishment for individual sin, we no longer have the Christian Gospel. The Gospel is only good news if <em>I</em> am a sinner, and if <em>I</em> deserve God‚Äôs wrath for my own sins, because only then may my own sins be forgiven in Christ so that <em>I</em> may be saved! CRT is a different notion of sin entirely, and thus, preaches a different Gospel entirely.</p>

<p><em>As we have said before, if any man is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you have recieved, he is to be accursed!</em> Gal 1:9</p>
