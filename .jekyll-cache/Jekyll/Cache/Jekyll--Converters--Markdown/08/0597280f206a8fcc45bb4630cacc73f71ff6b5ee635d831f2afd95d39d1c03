I"<p>“Out work” is one of my dad’s sayings. In a sense, it’s one of the statements he’s lived his life by, and it was one of the ethics he made sure to pass to me and my sister. My parents modeled hard work and smart choices for me throughout my childhood, and I learned a lot of lessons about commitment to a task and decision making because of their excellent example. I’m proud to say that hard work is a staple of our family’s life, and I hope that I model that as well as it was modeled to me.</p>
