I"<p>In 1931 a man named Kurt Gödel published the following theorem, which he named “Theorem VI” in a paper he published called <em>On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any consistent formal system F within which a certain amount of elementary arithmetic can be carried out is incomplete; i.e., there are statements of the language of F which can neither be proved nor disproved in F.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is important to understand what is meant by Gödel here, both by mathematicians like myself, and by laymen seeking to understand mathematics on a conceptual level. Contrary to popular opinion, mathematics can be understood by those who are not formally trained in it. Mathematics is not the study of the ethereal; classically, it is the study of the order which is found to arise in the workings of the world: form, structure, quantity, implication, and logic. Bad mathematics education divorces the grounding of mathematical concepts from the physical realities which inspired them. In the name of “purity”, math educators will subject their students a drivelous enumeration of algorithm, definition, theorem, and proof, which are difficult to be comprehended by almost any human mind. Good mathematics educators understand mathematics’ historical and pragmatic roots, and construct the substantive deductions of mathematical thinking from narrative, a framework which allows almost anyone to understand even the most profound mathematical truths.</p>

<p>Gödel was working during a time of great ambition and excitement in mathematics. Two men in particular, Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead, embodied a philosophy of mathematics known as  <em>logicism</em>, a central tenet of which was the belief that all statements in mathematics were be provable through logical deduction. If there was a mathematically true statement, Russell and Whitehead believed that it could be proved. Indeed this is the opinion of anyone with some exposure to math. The possibility of a true mathematical statement which could not be proved sounds like an absurdity, thus Russell and Whitehead sought to lay the foundation for proving the entirety of mathematics in their work they called <em>Principia Mathematica</em>.</p>

<p>Not more than a decade after the third edition of the <em>Principia</em> was published did Godel’s theorem drop a nuclear bomb on the entire foundation of the <em>Principia</em>. The “formal system” he speaks of in his theorem is any set of statements that are not inconsistent with each other, like the axioms of mathematics. The “arithmetic” is any way of combining these statements together to form new statements in the system, as is done with deductive and inductive logic in mathematical proof. Thus, by consequence of Godel’s theorem, we conclude that there are some theorems in mathematics which are true, but are not provable by any human being, or any computer, or anything which can make logical deductions from a set of axioms.</p>
