      <i>Eleutherius</i>, (eh-loo-ther-ee-us) from the Greek for <i>freeman</i>, was the name that one of my heroes Martin Luder gave himself when he published his 95 theses: Martin <i>Luther</i>. A freeman is not bound by the yoke of slavery or bondage, even if he be assailed with theological or political bonds. The right kind of freedom is the liberty to pursue fullness of virtue, not mere license to satisfy your every appetite. Virtuous living is the "happiness" part of Jefferson's "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness". It is the Stoic conception of the good life, that "will that is in agreement with the created order". It is the "freedom for which Christ has set us free", spoken of by the Apostle; that glorious liberty to be truly human. In Christ, we are free for the sake of true freedom: presently, by grace alone, we are citizens, sons, and co-heirs of His New Heavens and Earth. We are free from sin and condemnation, and free to risk obedience. These are our strength to face the day when we know that our lives are lived <i>coram deo</i>, before God.

      These great truths and others are the inspiration for my musings about virtue, piety, salvation, eschatology, and all the rest. The culmination, I hope, is Reformed and reforming commentary that's just edgy enough to be true, and just daring enough to be orthodox.
