Unapologetics: a play on the word _unapologetic_, meaning put forth without qualification, and the word _apologetics_, based on the Greek _apologia_, meaning a systematic argumentative discourse in defense of an idea.

How a society sees Christ dictates everything about it, just as how a person sees Christ dictates everything about they way they live. If Christ reigns supreme over all of life, then politics, economics, family life, romance, technology, science, and society will look a certain way. If He does not, then they will look a very different way. The Christendom and the Secular Kingdom are founded on entirely different axioms, rendering them fundamentally incompatible. In the former, life is lived _coram deo_, "before God", and in the latter, accountability must be engineered from a vacuum of nihilism.

My intention is to keep the topic of this blog broad. I contend one thing: that Christ reigns supreme over all of life.

My name is Chris Carter, and I'm not much more than a layman with a conviction to write. I've been told that my prose is straightforward, to the point, and unapologetic.
