<img src="/assets/img/chris-carter-6847.jpg" style="width:300px; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;" align="left"> My mission is to proclaim the Gospel for all of life.

And by all, I mean _all_. All of sexuality, family affairs, politics, business, government, technology, and so on, is to be brought into submission to Christ the King. There is nothing which is not ruled over by Him, and nothing which His Law does not apply to. Our culture, to the contrary, insists that God does not exist, that men can marry men, that babies can be killed in the womb, that the government has the right to steal 30% of your paycheck, and that boys can become girls if they want to. I insist, with the word of God as my final authority, that these statements come from an evil worldview that the American church has allowed to take over this Republic. Taking back the ground we have lost requires preaching the Gospel we have neglected to preach; the _whole_ Gospel, for _all_ of life.

The Gospel begins with real repentance and grows with Biblical theology. Hence, a lot of my writing looks like theological musing or apologetics. Some personal stuff, and some political commentary, but mostly worldview analysis and Biblical exposition. I myself am in accordance with the 1689 London Baptist Confession of faith, and I'm cautiously a Postmillenialist, so you can expect Reformed, optimistic, and fighty dialogue. For all my brashness and intellectualism, I take great joy in this fight.
