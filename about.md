<div class="container has-text-centered"><p>Hi there.</p></div>

I'm a confessional (1689) Reformed baptist postmillenialist, pretty much in that order, because Reformed postmillenialist confessional baptist just doesn't quite have the same ring to it. My only formal training is in mathematics and computer science, which are paying dividends with respect to reasoned dissections of worldview and scripture. That's my hope, anyway; four years of writing proofs, analyzing harmonic functions, and debugging max flow algorithms in C++ can't be all for nothing.

This blog is a work in progress, because, well, I'm a work in progress. I'd like to be the kind of man who possesses the kind of strength, gentleness, competence, and faith to handle every situation in life the right way. As such, I'd like this place to be the same, so don't be surprised if you see things change every so often around here. What you _should_ expect here is study notes, short essays, and other little snippets of prose that I've been mulling over in the car or discussing with friends. Hopefully my rambled musings can be a helpful resource to others as we press on towards a full knowledge of the faith.

Among men who have influenced me are my dad, for his "out work" ethic, both of my grandfathers, one for his creative and mystical spirit and the other for his unfailing pragmatism, and theologians like John Calvin, for his thoroughness, Jonathan Edwards, a kindred spirit, C.S. Lewis, for his allegory and poetry, R.C. Sproul, for his clarity, John MacArthur, for his exaction of scripture, and Douglas Wilson, for his jolly postmillenialism. I'm thankful for having received many good things from these men.
