  <p class="title is-4">Scope Creep</p>
  <p class="subtitle">May 15, 2020</p>

<div class="post-content">
  <p>I suspected months ago that Cuomo would extend the shutdown in New York State for at least another two weeks when we reached the May 15 deadline, regardless of the new evidence we have surrounding the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. I’m sad to say that I was right, and my prediction is that in the short-term we will have to be dealing with social distancing for months or years, and long-term life as we know it won’t return to a state of normalcy for another couple of years or decades.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Let’s be vulnerable for a second. I can count the people I truly trust on one hand, and the rest I assume are, at best, ambivalent to caring about me and the people I love, and at worse, downright opposed to the flourishing of anyone but themselves. You are my enemy before you are my friend, especially if you occupy a position of authority, and if you are sufficiently intelligent and powerful, I infer your motives from your actions.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>This whole initiative began as a way to mitigate a disease which was thought to be deadly and moderately contagious. Antibody testing and other studies have shown that the disease is orders of magnitude less deadly and far more contagious than we thought. This now renders social distancing and economic shutdown useless in stopping the disease, and in fact, means that they always <em>were</em> useless in stopping the disease. New York State even admitted during one of its own press conferences that most people who contracted the disease were carefully practicing social distancing and complying with the guidelines not to travel. Because of this, I am convinced that we have been shut down for two months for nothing. Businesses closed for nothing, churches closed for nothing, and people lost jobs for nothing. We ought instead to have isolated and quarantined the sick, and recommended that the at-risk remain at home.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Instead of admitting that the current measures aren’t working, Governor Cuomo and health officials chose to extend the shutdown for another two weeks, and retain emergency powers for another month (emergency powers, under NYS executive code, basically mean that the governor has the power to overturn any state or local ordinance). There is no scientific or democratic backing for this order.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>“Scope Creep” is when the end goal of an initiative is slowly broadened over time to include far more than the initial target did. It can be a major problem in software development, an aspect of my day job. We were told at the beginning of this fiasco that economic shutdown was a tool to flatten the curve, a term which means to reduce the peak number of daily new cases of COVID-19, but which was never defined in a rigorous manner for the public. Nothing was specified to enumerate the conditions of this goal. I believe we flattened the curve; I believe we did weeks ago, and yet the goal seems to have shifted among Fauci and his advisees that social distancing must continue until a cure is found. Who is to say that when we find a cure, or fulfill another epidemiological goal, that the goalpost won’t move again, and again, and again, until the disease is entirely eradicated from the planet in a few decades? What kinds of political conditions will be erected to authorize this perpetual scope creep?</p>
