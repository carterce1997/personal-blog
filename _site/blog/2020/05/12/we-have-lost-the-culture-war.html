<div class="post-content">
  <p>The COVID-19 government fiasco marked a critical turning point in the collective consciousness of the population of the United States and its relationship to the power and authority of government. We were once autonomous revolutionaries, who dreamed of the freedom to make our own way in life. Now we are merely a populace, whose majority will gladly give up its dreams and freedoms for safeties and legislation. Furthermore, few share the ethic which is presented in the Biblical text, which enumerates the value of life, the dignity of man, the glory and sacredness of sexuality, the appropriate expression of it in heterosexual marriage, the importance of the family unit as the building block of society, and the overarching moral law of love and servitude for fellow man.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The last 60 years or so have seen a culture war rage between the “traditionalists”, who derive their values mostly from the Bible even if they are not regenerate themselves, and the “progressives”, who reject the Bible as a prescriptive authority. In the last decade, and in fact, even in the most recent half of it, the progressives have made leaps and bounds normalizing their Biblically deviant worldview among the American people, first by dominating the space of television, then film and art, then philosophy, then law, and then business, and now more than ever through social media. The propaganda of the progressives has done so well at its task of normalization that even most rock-ribbed traditionalists carry around with them a maxim or two of progressive doctrine (hint: “just let them marry, people can do what they want” is one of them). Progressivism has successfully executed the dissolution of traditional values on a national scale.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>To the chagrin of the progressives, some traditionalists still exist as pockets of insurgents in a sea of progressive ideology, hated for the lives they live and the beliefs they retain. Some prefer to live in quiet solitude, and others, like me, were trained by their more progressive childhood friends to not care about the acceptance of others, and thus, we feel free to say whatever we want to. That said, as loud as we are individually, we don’t have the political clout we used to carry, and thus I find myself staying vocal out of duty, not pragmatism. Preaching the Gospel to a Godless post-Christian society is not pragmatic, but it is the only thing which we can hope will bring the people of our nation to God. The tyranny of progressivism will not be defeated through political means, all at once, but instead by the faithful preaching of the word of God to sinners who, by His grace, are redeemed, one soul at a time. Lucky for us, there are plenty of opportunities to do so.</p>
