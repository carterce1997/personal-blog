  <p><em>I’m mostly directing this post towards guys.</em></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><em>Correction: I’m mostly directing this post towards skinny guys.</em></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I set up the new “blog” section on this website to give myself a little more freedom from the more intellectual content I tend to product when talking about theology or philosophy or the sciences. Blog posts, for me, are often shorter, and give me a little more leeway to engage in loud-mouthed bombastic rants on government, or other things that I deem important and interesting. There’s no sense in being a one-dimensional troll, or a stuffy academic. Life is not the internet, nor is it something you can experience by reading about it.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I’ve been lifting weights for about four years of my life in a relatively serious manner. Bodybuilders and bodybuilding never did it for me. I’m not interested in carrying around big foamy muscles; I wanted to be strong. The guys I admired the most were old-school Olympic weightlifters: Bill Starr, Tom Suggs, Bill March, and the likes of guys who dedicated themselves to years of building the size and strength necessary to do big snatches, cleans, pulls, presses, and squats.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>As men age through their 20s and into their 30s, they seem to tend to widen and thicken. It’s not that they become obese (although that can happen), but rather that there appear to be physiological changes that occur in the bone structure of men as they mature. This happens to varying degrees. Some guys are naturally blessed with big wide shoulders and hips, and really build a fairly impressive frame by the time they reach their mid 20s. Other guys aren’t blessed to be naturally big, and they have to put some work into it. I’m a longer guy with narrow shoulders and hips, so I’m not really built to be big or to set records in the strength sports. There are, however, things any skinny guy can do to look big and strong.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>One of the things that tends to make men look thin are slouched and skinny shoulders. Working on your posture by doing heavy deadlifts with a straight back will build your lats, traps, rhomboids, and erectors, all of which work to pull your chest up and your shoulders back. Skinny shoulders can be fixed by frequently pressing on a bench and, more importantly, pressing overhead from a standing position. These exercises add mass to the shoulders and chest, and this mass combined with the postural corrections provided by the deadlift make the overall appearance of the upper body look bigger.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>By far though, the best way to build a whole lot of mass on the body is by doing frequent, heavy squatting. Squatting builds the hips, quads, calves, abs, and back, and it provides a good hormonal stimulus to make everything else grow too. Skinny legs and a big wide upper body indicate a man who is more concerned with how he looks in the bathroom mirror than how effective he is at doing something useful; 9 times out of 10, your legs and back will save your ass before your pecs will. In my opinion, you should squat with the widest stance that also allows you to hit the most depth.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Other things, like wide grip chin-ups, shouls be included in the routine, as they hit the lats and work the biceps a little bit too. The biceps aren’t terribly useful muscles, but small biceps tend to look silly on a big guy, so we might as well try to make them grow as well. Other details, like bracing your belly during heavy squats and deadlifts, will develop the abs all around the midsection, and keep your waist and belly from looking too skinny to be pragmatic.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>If you’re a guy with a skinny frame, like me, chances are you won’t be setting records and you won’t become the next Arnold. Regardless, there are things any guy of any size can do to build his stature.</p>
