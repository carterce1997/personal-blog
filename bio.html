      Welcome! I am a Calvinist postmillenialist; those two things are among the surest of what I know from holy scripture. Most of what I write here is a way for me to figure out what those two things really mean, and to impart to others what the ramifications of them are for the rest of life itself. I hope you can be blessed by what I do here.

      This blog (and podcast) is the chicken scratch of a layman with too many thoughts bouncing around in his head. I'm a farm kid from rural Vermont with a degree in mathematics. Both experiences endowed me with skills that carry over nicely to many other endeavors in my life. That's a good thing, since my interests are a wandering, various, and sundry collection of everything from probability theory to physical culture to Reformed theology.
